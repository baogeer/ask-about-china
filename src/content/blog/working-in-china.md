## The Work Visa, Residence Permit, and Work Permit Card

Understanding the key documents is the first step. You will encounter three core items: the Z Visa, the Foreigner's Work
Permit, and the Residence Permit. They are not interchangeable and serve different purposes.

- **Z Visa:** This is an entry visa. You apply for it in your home country before you travel to China. It is typically
  valid for only 30 days upon entry, giving you a window to complete the next steps.
- **Foreigner's Work Permit:** Before you can even apply for a Z visa, your employer must secure a "Notification Letter
  of Foreigner's Work Permit" for you. Once you arrive in China, this is converted into a physical "Work Permit Card."
  This card classifies you into a category (A, B, or C) based on your qualifications, salary, and experience. Class A is
  for top-tier talent, B for professional workers, and C for non-technical roles.
- **Residence Permit:** This is the most important document for your long-term stay. After arriving, you must convert
  your Z Visa into a Residence Permit at the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) Exit-Entry Administration. This permit
  is affixed to a page in your passport and allows you to live in China and make multiple entries and exits for its
  duration (usually one year).

Your employer is your sponsor and will guide you through this process, which can vary slightly by city and province.

## Initial Steps Upon Arrival

Once you land in China, you have a few immediate and critical tasks to complete.

### Mandatory Police Registration

By law, all foreigners must register their place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) within 24
hours of arrival. If you are staying in a hotel, the front desk will handle this for you automatically during check-in.
However, if you move into an apartment or stay with a friend, you must go to the nearest local police station yourself
with your landlord and rental agreement to register. Failure to do so can result in fines or visa complications.

### Medical Examination

To finalize your Work Permit and Residence Permit, you will need to undergo a standardized medical examination at a
government-designated health center. Your employer's HR department will direct you to the correct facility. The check-up
typically includes a physical exam, blood tests, an ECG, and a chest X-ray.

## Understanding Your Employment Contract

Your Chinese employment contract is a critical legal document. It's wise to request a bilingual version (Chinese and
English), but note that the Chinese version will almost always take legal precedence in a dispute.

Key things to look for:

- **Term:** Contracts can be fixed-term (e.g., one or two years) or open-term. Most foreign workers start on a
  fixed-term contract.
- **Probation Period:** Probation periods are legally regulated based on the contract length. For a three-year contract,
  the maximum probation is six months.
- **Working Hours & Overtime:** The standard work week is 40 hours. The contract should specify policies regarding
  overtime pay and compensation, which are regulated by law.

## Payroll, Tax, and Social Insurance

China's payroll system has several components you need to understand.

### Individual Income Tax (IIT)

China uses a progressive tax system with rates from 3% to 45%. Your employer will deduct tax from your monthly salary.
At the end of the fiscal year (which is the calendar year), you or a tax agent must complete an annual tax
reconciliation to ensure you have paid the correct amount.

### Social Insurance and Housing Fund

The social security system consists of "five insurances and one housing fund." This includes pensions, medical,
unemployment, work-related injury, and maternity insurance, plus the housing fund. Rules for foreign employee
participation vary significantly by city. In some cities like Shanghai, participation is mandatory; in others, it may be
optional or not applicable. Clarify this with your employer.

### Compliant Reimbursements (Fapiao)

If your company provides expense reimbursements for things like meals, transport, or housing, you must provide official
invoices known as "fapiao." These are government-registered receipts that vendors provide upon request. You cannot be
reimbursed without them, so always remember to ask for a fapiao (要发票, *yào fāpiào*).

## Daily Life Logistics for Foreign Workers

### Banking and Payments

Opening a local bank account is essential for receiving your salary. You'll need your passport with a valid residence
permit. Once your account is open, link it to Alipay and WeChat Pay. These two apps are used for nearly all transactions
in China, from paying for groceries to booking taxis.

### Housing and the Hukou System

As a foreigner, you can rent an apartment freely. The *hukou* (household registration system) primarily applies to
Chinese citizens and generally does not impact your ability to live and work in a city as a foreign professional.

### Bringing Your Family (Dependents)

If you hold a valid work-based residence permit, you can sponsor your spouse and children to come to China. They will
typically apply for an S1 (long-term) or S2 (short-term) visa. An S1 visa must be converted into a dependent residence
permit within 30 days of arrival.

## Legal Compliance and Offboarding

### Staying Compliant

- **No Illegal Part-Time Work:** Your work permit ties you to one employer for a specific role. Undertaking paid
  part-time work for another company is illegal and can lead to fines and deportation.
- **Teaching English:** If you want to teach, you need a work permit specifically for a teaching position at a licensed
  educational institution. Teaching on a different type of work permit is illegal.
- **Do Not Overstay Your Visa:** Always be aware of your residence permit's expiry date. Start the renewal process with
  your employer at least 30-60 days in advance.

### Leaving Your Job (Offboarding)

When your employment ends, you cannot simply leave the country. Your employer must officially cancel your Work Permit
and Residence Permit. You will receive cancellation letters and may need to obtain tax clearance to prove you have
settled all your income taxes. The PSB will then issue you a 30-day stay permit (humanitarian visa) to give you time to
either find a new job and transfer your permit or arrange your departure from China.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q: Can I change employers in China?**\
A: Yes, it is possible. The process involves your current employer cancelling your work permit and your new employer
applying to have it transferred. This must be done seamlessly to avoid any gap in your legal status. It requires careful
coordination between you and both companies.

**Q: Is it legal to work remotely from China for a foreign company?**\
A: This is a legal gray area. To live in China long-term, you need a residence permit, which is typically tied to a
local employer. Working for an overseas company while on a tourist or business visa is illegal. Consult with a legal
expert for specific scenarios.

**Q: Can my spouse work if they come on a dependent visa (S1)?**\
A: No. A dependent residence permit does not grant the right to work. If your spouse wishes to work, they must find an
employer willing to sponsor them for their own work permit.

**Q: How do I get a Chinese driver's license?**\
A: China does not recognize International Driving Permits. To drive legally, you must obtain a Chinese driver's license.
If you have a license from your home country, you can typically get a Chinese license by passing a written theory test.

**Q: What are the typical public holidays and annual leave policies?**\
A: China has several major public holidays, including Chinese New Year (Spring Festival), National Day, and Dragon Boat
Festival. Legally mandated annual leave depends on your cumulative years of service (both in and outside China) and
starts at 5 days, increasing to 10 and then 15 days.

## The Rules of the Road

China drives on the right-hand side of the road, similar to the United States and most of Europe. Key traffic laws are
enforced seriously, often through a widespread network of cameras. You are required to wear a seat belt, and using a
mobile phone while driving is illegal. Drunk-driving laws are extremely strict, with severe penalties.

Speed limits vary by location. On national expressways, limits typically range from 100 to 120 km/h (about 62-75 mph).
In urban areas, the limit usually drops to between 40 and 60 km/h (about 25-37 mph). Be mindful that speed camera
systems are common.

For official details, refer to
the [China Road Traffic Safety Law (中华人民共和国道路交通安全法)](http://www.gov.cn/flfg/2003-10/28/content_32759.htm) (
in Chinese).

## Road Conditions and Signage

You’ll find China's expressway system to be modern and well-maintained, connecting major cities with ease. Urban roads
can be a different story, with congestion being a daily reality in large cities. Rural roads are more variable in
quality. Major road signs on expressways and in big cities often include English, but this becomes less common in
smaller towns and rural areas.

Most expressways are toll roads. Many have moved to an electronic toll collection (ETC) system, though cash lanes still
exist. Using navigation apps like [Baidu Maps](https://map.baidu.com/) or [Amap (高德地图)](https://www.amap.com/) is
essential for getting around.

## On-the-Road Culture and Etiquette

Driving in China involves a different kind of road etiquette. Horns are often used as a way to signal your presence,
rather than as a sign of aggression. You may encounter a more flexible approach to lane discipline, and merging can feel
like a game of assertiveness.

One of the biggest adjustments is sharing the road with a huge number of scooters, e-bikes, and pedestrians. They may
not always follow traffic signals, so defensive driving is crucial. While pedestrian crossings exist, don't assume
traffic will automatically stop for you.

navigation apps, traffic alerts, and local e-services.

## Common Challenges for Foreigners

Navigating can be tough without some knowledge of Chinese, as many local signs and app interfaces are in Mandarin.
Cashless systems for tolls and parking are becoming the norm, which can be tricky without local payment apps. You might
also encounter environmental restriction zones in certain cities or police checkpoints, where you'll need to present
your documents.

## Getting Your Chinese Driver's License

Your International Driving Permit (IDP) is **not recognized in China**. To drive legally, you must obtain a Chinese
license.

- **For Residents:** If you have a valid foreign license, you can typically convert it. This process usually involves a
  health check, providing a translated copy of your home license, and passing a written theory test. The test is
  available in English in major cities.
- **For Short-Term Visitors:** Some cities offer temporary driving permits for stays up to three months. This process is
  generally simpler and may not require a theory test, but requirements vary by location.

For official procedures, refer to
the [China Driver License Application Guide (公安部交通管理局)](https://www.mps.gov.cn/n2254996/n4904355/n4914365/index.html).

A few practical tips can make your experience smoother: always carry your passport and license, use a reliable
navigation app, plan for tolls, and try to avoid driving during rush hour in major cities. With a bit of preparation,
you can confidently navigate China’s dynamic roads.

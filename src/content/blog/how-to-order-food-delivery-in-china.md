In China, food delivery (Wàimài) has become a way of life. Whether you're at home, in the office, or at a hotel, a hot
meal can be delivered to your door within half an hour with just a few taps on your phone. For foreign tourists or new
arrivals, mastering how to use food delivery apps can significantly enhance your convenience and culinary experience.
This guide will walk you through the skills of ordering food delivery in China step by step.

### Food Delivery in China: Popularity and Platforms

In China, food delivery services cover nearly every corner, from major cities to small towns. You can order not only
dishes from restaurants but also groceries, medicine, coffee, milk tea, and even flowers and electronics.

The two most popular food delivery platforms are:

- [**Meituan (美团)**](/most-useful-apps-for-living-in-china): Its logo is a yellow kangaroo. It is a comprehensive
  lifestyle service platform, with food delivery being one of its core businesses.
- [**Ele.me (饿了么)**](/how-to-use-mobile-payments-in-china): Its logo is a blue bamboo dragonfly. It is part of the
  Alibaba Group and also offers a wide range of delivery options.

The functions and usage of these two apps are very similar. Once you learn how to use one, you can easily navigate the
other.

### Basic Steps for Using a Food Delivery App

Let's use "Meituan" as an example to see how to complete a food delivery order.

1. **Download and Register**\
   First, search for "Meituan" or "Ele.me" in your phone's app store and download it. The registration process usually
   requires a mainland China mobile number to receive a verification code. After registering, you can
   link [WeChat Pay or Alipay](/how-to-use-mobile-payments-in-china) as your payment method.
2. **Set Your Delivery Address**\
   This is the most crucial step. After opening the app, you will be prompted to set a delivery address. You need to
   accurately enter the address of your hotel, apartment, or office. The app usually has a map-based location feature to
   help you pinpoint your location. An accurate address ensures the delivery driver can find you smoothly.
3. **Browse Restaurants and Menus**\
   On the app's homepage, you'll see a variety of nearby restaurants. You can use the search bar at the top to look for
   specific dishes (like "beef noodles") or filter by categories (such as "fast food," "Chinese food," or "Western
   food"). The app interface is rich with images, so even if you don't understand Chinese, you can get a good idea of
   the food from the pictures.
4. **Place Your Order and Pay**\
   After entering a restaurant's page, you can start ordering. Tap on the dishes you want, and they will be added to
   your shopping cart. Once you've selected everything, click "Go to checkout" (去结算, Qù jiésuàn). On the checkout
   page, you will see the total amount, including the cost of the food, packaging fees, and delivery fee. After
   confirming, select your payment method and complete the payment.
5. **Wait for Delivery**\
   Once your order is successful, the app will display the real-time status of your order, including "Merchant has
   accepted the order," "Rider has picked up the food," and "In delivery." You can also see the delivery person's (
   rider's) real-time location and estimated arrival time.

### Tips for Ordering Food Delivery

- **Choose a reliable restaurant**: Before ordering, be sure to check the restaurant's rating and user reviews (see more
  in our [China Travel Tips](/china-travel-tips)). Restaurants with high scores and labels like "Eat with confidence"
  are generally more trustworthy. You can look at the pictures in the reviews to see what the dishes really look like.
- **Pay attention to minimum spending and delivery fees**: Most restaurants have a "minimum spending amount" (起送价,
  Qǐsòngjià), which means your order total must reach this amount to qualify for delivery. Additionally, there will be
  a "delivery fee" (配送费, Pèisòngfèi) of a few RMB.
- **Peak hours**: Lunch (11:30 AM - 1:00 PM) and dinner (5:30 PM - 7:00 PM) are peak dining times, and delivery may take
  longer. If you're in a hurry, it's best to order in advance.
- **Add your special requests**: On the checkout page, there is a "remarks" (备注, Bèizhù) section. You can write
  special requests here, such as "not spicy" (不要辣, Búyào là) or "extra rice" (多加米饭, Duō jiā mǐfàn).
- **Be ready to answer your phone**: The delivery rider may call you when they arrive or if they can't find the
  location. If your Chinese isn't fluent, you can ask the hotel's front desk or a friend nearby to help answer the call.

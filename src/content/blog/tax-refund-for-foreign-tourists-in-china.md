Shopping in China is a highlight for many visitors, and for eligible foreign travelers, there's an added bonus: claiming
a refund on the Value-Added Tax (VAT). While the process is governed by clear rules, it requires advance planning and
strict adherence to the procedures. This guide will break down every step, complete with key links and resources, to
help you navigate the system and successfully get your money back.

## Overview

This guide is designed to help you understand who qualifies for a tax refund, what documents to prepare, the specific
airport procedures, and how to avoid common mistakes. For the smoothest possible departure, we recommend reading this
guide alongside our [China Airport Customs Guide](/china-airport-customs-guide/) to understand the complete flow from
Customs validation to collecting your refund.

## Eligibility & Core Rules

Before you start shopping, make sure you meet all the core requirements for a tax refund.

- **Applicant Eligibility:** The policy applies to foreign tourists and residents of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan who
  have stayed in Mainland China for no more than 183 consecutive days. You must also hold a valid entry document, such
  as a [visa or proof of visa-free eligibility](/apply-for-chinese-visa/).
- **Designated Tax Refund Stores:** Purchases must be made at stores officially marked with the “Tax Refund” logo. Ask
  staff or look for the sign before you buy. For more details, you can consult the \[External link placeholder: official
  tax refund policy overview and store list].
- **Minimum Spending Amount:** Your total purchases at a single designated store on a single day must meet a minimum
  spending threshold set by the government. Confirm the current amount with store staff at the time of purchase.
- **Time Window & Unused Condition:** The goods must be exported from Mainland China within 90 days of the purchase
  date. Crucially, the items must remain in **unused** condition and in their original packaging. Customs officers will
  inspect the goods to verify this.

## What to Prepare

Before leaving for the airport, gather all the necessary documents and items in one easily accessible place.

- **Your Original Passport**
- **Boarding Pass or E-Ticket Itinerary**
- **Original Sales Invoices/Receipts** from your purchases
- **Completed Tax Refund Application Forms** issued by the store
- **All purchased goods, unused and in their original packaging**

**CRITICAL REMINDER:** Do not pack your tax refund goods in your checked luggage before completing
the [Customs Validation](/china-airport-customs-guide/) step! Keep them in your carry-on or at the top of a suitcase you
can open easily.

## The Airport Process: Step-by-Step Guide

Following these steps in the correct order is essential for a successful claim.

### Step 1: Go to the Customs Validation Counter (Before Check-in)

When you arrive at the airport, your **first stop** is not the airline check-in desk, but the "Customs Validation"
counter located in the departure hall. Present all your prepared documents and the purchased goods to the Customs
officer.

### Step 2: Get Your Application Forms Stamped

The officer will review your documents and may open your bags to inspect the goods, confirming they are unused and match
the paperwork. Once verified, the officer will stamp your Tax Refund Application Forms. This stamp is the non-negotiable
proof of approval you need.

### Step 3: Check-in and Clear Security

After getting the Customs stamp, you can proceed to your airline’s counter to check in and drop off your luggage. You
may now pack the validated goods in your checked baggage. Afterward, continue through exit immigration and security as
usual.

### Step 4: Claim Your Refund

Once you are in the international departure area, find the designated "Tax Refund Counter" or a self-service kiosk.
Submit your stamped application forms and choose your preferred payout method.

## Refund Methods & Timelines

You can typically choose between cash and a credit to your bank card.

- **Cash Refund:** Get paid immediately in Chinese Yuan (CNY) at the airport counter. This is the fastest option but may
  be subject to a payout limit and service fees.
- **Credit Card Refund:** Have the funds sent back to your credit or debit card. This option takes longer, and
  processing times vary. For details, check the \[External link placeholder: operator terms/processing time
  information].

Note that a service fee, charged by the tax refund operator, will be deducted from your total refund amount.

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these common mistakes to ensure your refund claim is not rejected.

- **Packing Goods Before Validation:** This is the most frequent error. If you cannot present the goods for inspection,
  Customs will not stamp your forms.
- **Incorrect Form Information:** When shopping, double-check that your name and passport number on the Tax Refund
  Application Form exactly match your passport.
- **Rushing at the Airport:** The validation and refund process can involve queues, especially during peak travel
  seasons. Arrive at the airport earlier than you normally would. For more tips on navigating busy periods, see
  our [Legal Guide to Traveling in China](/legal-guide-to-traveling-in-china/).

## Special Situations

- **Domestic Connection Before International Departure:** You must complete Customs validation at your **final port of
  departure** from Mainland China. For example, if your itinerary is Xi'an -> Shanghai -> New York, you will complete
  the process at the airport in Shanghai. Refer to the [airport customs guide](/china-airport-customs-guide/) for more
  on this.
- **Traveling with Others:** The person named on the Tax Refund Application Form must be the one carrying the goods and
  departing the country. A friend cannot carry the items for you.
- **Partial Refunds:** A single application form corresponds to an entire transaction. Partial refunds for only some
  items on a single form are generally not supported.

## Quick Checklist

- Original passport
- Boarding pass or itinerary
- Completed Tax Refund Application Forms
- Original sales receipts
- Unused goods in original packaging, ready for inspection
- Extra time budgeted for the airport process

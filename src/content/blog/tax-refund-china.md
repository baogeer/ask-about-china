## What Is the Tourist Tax Refund?

When you buy goods in China, the price often includes a **Value-Added Tax (VAT)**.  
The **tourist tax refund scheme** allows eligible foreign visitors to claim back a portion of this tax on qualifying
items.  
This policy is designed to encourage tourism and make shopping more attractive for international travelers.

You can also read the official overview on
the [China Customs Administration website (in English)](http://english.customs.gov.cn/).

The refund is not the full VAT amount, as a service fee is deducted by the refund agency.  
The program applies to goods purchased at specific, authorized stores that you personally carry out of Mainland China.

## Who Is Eligible for a Tax Refund?

To qualify for a tax refund, you must meet several key criteria. All conditions must be met to successfully process your
claim.

- **Visitor Status:** You must be a foreign national or a resident of Hong Kong, Macao, or Taiwan.
- **Duration of Stay:** Your cumulative stay in Mainland China must not exceed 183 days.
- **Designated Stores:** You must shop at stores that are part of the official **“Tax Refund Shopping”** scheme. These
  shops
  are identifiable by a logo, often displayed near the entrance or at the cash register.
- **Minimum Spend:** You need to spend a minimum amount in a single store on a single day. This threshold varies by
  city, so always check the in-store signage or ask a staff member for the current requirement.
- **Departure Timeline:** You must depart Mainland China within a specific timeframe after the purchase date, which is
  typically 90 days.
- **Unused Goods:** The items you purchased must be unused and in their original packaging. You are required to take
  them with you when you leave the country.

## The Step-by-Step Refund Process

Follow these steps to ensure your claim is processed without any issues.

### 1. At the Store

When paying for your goods, inform the cashier that you want to apply for a **tax refund**.  
You will need to present your passport.  
The store will then issue an official **Tax Refund Application Form** along with your receipt.  
Double-check that your name and passport number on the form are accurate before you leave.

### 2. At Customs Validation (Before Check-In)

On your departure day, arrive at the airport earlier than usual.  
Before checking in your luggage, locate the **Customs validation counter**.  
Present the officer with your passport, boarding pass, refund form, and the purchased goods.  
The officer may inspect the items to verify they are unused. Once approved, your form will be stamped.

**Crucial Tip:** Do not pack your tax-free items in your checked baggage before getting the Customs stamp.  
You must be able to present them for inspection.

### 3. At the Refund Counter (After Security)

After clearing security and immigration, find the designated **tax refund counter or self-service kiosk**.  
Submit your stamped Tax Refund Application Form to the agent or scan it at the kiosk.

### 4. Receiving Your Refund

You can typically choose how you want to receive your money:

- **Cash:** Usually in Chinese Yuan (RMB).
- **Credit Card:** The refund can be credited back to your bank card. This may take several business days or weeks to
  appear in your account.

---

## Fees, Exchange Rates, and Timelines

It's helpful to manage your expectations regarding the final amount and timing of your refund.

- **Service Fees:** A service fee is always deducted from the VAT amount by the refund operator.
- **Exchange Rates:** If you choose to have the refund credited to a foreign currency credit card, the transaction will
  be subject to the exchange rate at the time of processing.
- **Processing Time:** While cash refunds are immediate, credit card refunds require processing time and may take
  several days or even weeks.

You can also compare rates
with [China’s official currency exchange reference](https://www.pbc.gov.cn/en/3688110/index.html).

## Practical Tips for a Smooth Process

- **Don't Check Your Goods:** Keep your tax-free purchases in your carry-on luggage or easily accessible until after you
  have passed the Customs validation step.
- **Arrive Early:** Customs and refund counters can have long lines during peak travel seasons.
- **Match Your Details:** Ensure the name and passport number on your refund form, passport, and boarding pass match
  perfectly.
- **Confirm Local Rules:** Minimum spending amounts and specific procedures can vary slightly between airports and
  cities.

## Quick FAQ

- **Can someone else carry the items for me?**  
  No. The person whose name is on the tax refund form must be the one carrying the goods and departing the country.
- **What if my journey includes a domestic flight first?**  
  Complete the refund process at your final international departure airport from Mainland China (e.g., Shanghai or
  Beijing).
- **Can I claim a refund for only some of the items on my form?**  
  Generally, refunds apply to the entire validated form; partial claims are uncommon.

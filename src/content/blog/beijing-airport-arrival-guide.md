Landing in a new country can be overwhelming, especially when you're arriving at one of the world's busiest airport
hubs. Beijing, served by two massive international airports—Beijing Capital (PEK) and Beijing Daxing (PKX)—is an
exciting entry point to China. This guide will walk you through the entire arrival process, from the moment you step off
the plane to the moment you check into your hotel, ensuring a smooth and stress-free start to your adventure.

We'll cover everything you need to know for both airports, so you can navigate immigration, baggage claim, and ground
transport like a seasoned traveler. This guide is a crucial companion to our broader [**China Travel Preparation Guide
**](/travel-preparation-guide) and our detailed [**China Visa Application Guide**](/apply-for-chinese-visa).

## 1. PEK vs. PKX: An Overview for First-Timers

Beijing has two main international airports, and your arrival experience will depend on which one you fly into.

- **Beijing Capital International Airport (PEK):** Located northeast of the city center, PEK is one of the world's
  busiest airports. Most international flights arrive at **Terminal 3 (T3)**, a massive, modern facility, while some
  arrive at **Terminal 2 (T2)**. It's well-connected to the city via the Airport Express train.
- **Beijing Daxing International Airport (PKX):** Located south of the city, PKX is a newer, architecturally stunning
  airport that opened in 2019. Known for its futuristic starfish design, it's designed for efficiency, with shorter
  walking distances from security to gates. It also has excellent high-speed rail and metro connections.

Both airports are modern and equipped with bilingual signage (Mandarin/English), making them relatively easy for
international visitors to navigate.

## 2. Before You Land: Get Your Documents Ready

A smooth arrival starts before the plane even touches down. While in the air, flight attendants will hand out an
arrival/departure card.

### Key Documents to Have in Hand:

- **Valid Passport and Chinese Visa:** Ensure your passport has at least six months of validity. Your visa should be for
  the correct purpose of your visit.
- **Completed Arrival/Departure Card:** Fill this out completely and legibly. You will need your flight number and
  passport details.
- **Proof of Onward Travel:** Have a printed or digital copy of your return or onward flight ticket. Immigration
  officers may ask to see it.
- **Hotel Address in Chinese:** This is crucial. Have a screenshot of your hotel's name, address, and phone number in
  Chinese characters.
- **Health & Customs Declaration:** You may need to complete a health declaration via a QR code or paper form. Be honest
  about what you are carrying.

**Currency Tip:** It's wise to have a small amount of Chinese Yuan (CNY) cash on hand for immediate expenses like a
taxi, but avoid exchanging large amounts at the airport due to less favorable rates.

## 3. The Arrival Flow: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to navigate the arrival process at either PEK or PKX. The process is linear and well-signed.

1. **Deplaning:** Follow the signs for "Arrivals" and "Immigration/Passport Control."
2. **Health & Quarantine:** You may pass through automated temperature scanners. If required, present your completed
   health declaration form or QR code.
3. **Immigration:** This is the main checkpoint. Get in the queue for "Foreigners." Present your passport, visa, and
   completed arrival card to the officer. They will take your photo and fingerprints. They might ask simple questions
   like "What is the purpose of your visit?" or "How long will you stay?"
4. **Baggage Claim:** After clearing immigration, check the large screens to find your flight number and the
   corresponding baggage carousel. Grab a free luggage trolley to make things easier.
5. **Customs:** Once you have your bags, proceed through customs. If you have nothing to declare, take the "Green
   Channel." If you are carrying items that need to be declared, use the "Red Channel." All bags will go through a final
   X-ray scanner.
6. **Arrival Hall:** Congratulations, you've officially entered China! The arrival hall is a bustling area where you'll
   find transport options, currency exchange, and SIM card counters.

## 4. Connectivity & Payments on Arrival

Getting connected and setting up payments is your first priority in China's digital-first environment.

### Getting Online

- **Airport Wi-Fi:** Both PEK and PKX offer free Wi-Fi. You can get an access code by scanning your passport at a
  designated kiosk. Note that this Wi-Fi is behind the "Great Firewall," so sites like Google and Instagram will be
  blocked.

- **eSIM vs. Local SIM:**

    - **eSIM:** The easiest option. You can purchase and install an eSIM before you travel, activating it upon landing
      for immediate internet access. Our [**guide to internet access in China**](/internet-access-in-china) has more
      details.
    - **Local SIM Card:** You can buy a physical SIM card from counters like China Unicom or China Mobile in the arrival
      hall. You will need your passport for registration. This is a reliable option but involves queuing. See our [*
      *expat SIM card guide**](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china) for tips.

### Setting Up Payments

Once you are online, you can set up Alipay or WeChat Pay by linking your international credit card. This is essential
for paying for nearly everything, from subway tickets to street food.

## 5. Getting into the City: PEK & PKX Transport

Avoid the touts offering private cars in the arrival hall. Only use official, marked transportation options.

### From Beijing Capital (PEK)

- **Airport Express Train:** The best option. It connects T2 and T3 to the city's subway system at Sanyuanqiao (Line 10)
  and Dongzhimen (Lines 2 & 13). **Cost:** 25 CNY. **Time:** \~20-30 mins.
- **Airport Bus:** A cheaper but slower option with multiple routes serving different parts of Beijing. **Cost:** 20-30
  CNY. **Time:** 60-90+ mins.
- **Licensed Taxi:** Follow signs to the official taxi queue. The ride is metered. **Cost:** \~100-150 CNY to the city
  center. **Time:** 45-70 mins.
- **Ride-Hailing (Didi):** Use the Didi app to call a car. You will meet your driver at a designated ride-hailing pickup
  point.

### From Beijing Daxing (PKX)

- **Daxing Airport Express:** A fast, new metro line connecting PKX to Caoqiao station (Line 10). **Cost:** 35 CNY. *
  *Time:** \~20 mins.
- **High-Speed Rail:** The airport has an integrated high-speed rail station connecting to Beijing West Railway Station.
  **Cost:** \~30 CNY. **Time:** \~25 mins.
- **Licensed Taxi:** Follow signs to the official taxi stand. **Cost:** \~180-250 CNY to the city center. **Time:**
  60-90 mins.

**Late-Night Tip:** The Airport Express and metro lines stop running around 11:00 PM. If you arrive late, a licensed
taxi or Didi is your best option. Be aware of scams, especially at night; read our guide on the [**most common scams in
Beijing**](/most-common-scams-in-beijing). For a full transport overview, see our [**transportation in China guide
**](/transportation-in-china).

## 6. Finding Your Hotel Smoothly

The final leg of your journey is getting to your hotel.

1. **Show the Chinese Address:** This is the golden rule. Show the screenshot of your hotel's address in Chinese to your
   taxi or Didi driver.
2. **Notify for Late Arrival:** If you have a late flight, inform your hotel in advance to ensure they hold your room.
3. **Prepare for a Deposit:** Hotels in China require a cash security deposit upon check-in, which is refunded upon
   departure after a room check.
4. **PSB Registration:** The hotel staff will scan your passport to register your stay with the local Public Security
   Bureau (PSB). This is a mandatory and routine procedure.

For more details on booking and check-in, consult our guide on [**How to Book a Hotel in China**](/).

Both PEK and PKX are well-equipped to handle traveler needs.

- **Luggage:** Free trolleys are abundant. Porter services are available for a fee. Luggage storage counters are located
  in the arrival and departure halls.

## 8. Common Arrival Issues and How to Fix Them

- **Missed Connection:** Go directly to your airline's transfer desk for assistance.
- **Lost Baggage:** Proceed to the Lost & Found or your airline's baggage service counter in the baggage claim area.
- **No Cash for a Taxi:** Most taxis now accept Alipay/WeChat Pay. If not, use your card at an ATM in the arrival hall.
- **Phone Not Connecting:** Restart your phone. Ensure data roaming is enabled on your eSIM or that your physical SIM is
  correctly installed.
- **Language Barrier with Taxi Driver:** Use your translation app and the screenshot of your hotel's Chinese address.

Booking a hotel in China can seem confusing at first, with different platforms, payment methods, and local rules to
consider. But with a little preparation, you can easily find and secure the perfect place to stay. This guide breaks
down everything you need to know, from choosing the right booking site to navigating check-in like a pro.

We’ll cover where to book, how to pay, and essential tips for a smooth experience. You’ll learn how to ensure your
chosen hotel can legally host foreigners and what to do when you arrive.

## Where to Book Your Hotel in China

You have several options for booking accommodation in China, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.

### Global Booking Sites (OTAs)

Platforms like Booking.com and Agoda are popular choices for international travelers. They offer familiar interfaces and
English-language customer support.

- **Pros:** Easy to use, multi-language support, loyalty programs, and reviews from a global user base. Payment is often
  straightforward with international credit cards.
- **Cons:** Fewer listings in smaller cities or rural areas. Prices can sometimes be slightly higher than on local
  platforms.

**Key Tip:** Even on these sites, you must confirm that the hotel accepts foreign guests. Look for phrases like "This
property is able to accept foreign guests" in the hotel description or policies section.

### China-Focused Platforms

Trip.com (formerly Ctrip) and Fliggy (owned by Alibaba) are the dominant players in China's travel market. Trip.com is
particularly user-friendly for foreigners, with a dedicated English site and app.

- **Pros:** The most extensive selection of hotels across all city tiers, often with better prices and promotions.
  Trip.com has excellent English support.
- **Cons:** Fliggy is primarily in Chinese and deeply integrated with Alipay, making it less accessible if you don't use
  the app. You still need to verify if the hotel accepts foreigners.

### Direct Hotel Websites & WeChat Accounts

Major international hotel chains (Marriott, Hilton, IHG) and some domestic chains have their own websites and WeChat
Official Accounts or Mini Programs for direct booking.

- **Pros:** Access to loyalty program benefits, potential for special member rates, and direct communication with the
  hotel.
- **Cons:** Can be cumbersome to book across different brands. WeChat Mini Programs may require a Chinese payment
  method.

## Confirming a Hotel Can Host Foreigners

This is the single most important step. Not all hotels in China are licensed to host non-Chinese nationals. If you book
one that isn't, you will be turned away upon arrival, regardless of your reservation.

Here’s how to check:

1. **Filter Your Search:** On Trip.com and Agoda, you can often filter results to show only properties that accept
   foreigners. This is the easiest method.
2. **Read the Fine Print:** On any booking platform, carefully read the "Hotel Policies," "Important Information," or "
   House Rules" sections. Look for explicit confirmation that they accept foreign passport holders.
3. **Contact the Hotel:** If you are unsure, contact the hotel directly. Use the chat function in the booking app or
   find their contact details. A simple message like, "Hello, can you please confirm that you accept guests with foreign
   passports?" is sufficient.

## Booking Requirements and Payment Options

Once you've found a suitable hotel, you'll need to provide some information and handle payment.

### Common Booking Requirements

- **Passport Details:** You will need to provide your full name as it appears on your passport and sometimes your
  passport number.
- **Estimated Arrival Time:** This helps the hotel manage check-ins, especially if you plan to arrive late.
- **Deposit:** Many hotels require a security deposit at check-in, usually paid in cash (CNY) or charged to a credit
  card. It's refunded upon checkout after they inspect the room.

### Navigating Payments

- **International Credit Cards (Visa, Mastercard):** Widely accepted by international hotel chains and on global OTAs
  like Booking.com. They are less commonly accepted at smaller, independent hotels.
- **UnionPay:** If you have a UnionPay card, it's accepted almost everywhere.
- **Alipay and WeChat Pay:** These are the primary payment methods in China. As a tourist, you can now link your
  international credit card to both Alipay and WeChat Pay. This allows you to pay like a local by scanning QR codes at
  the hotel.
- **Pay at the Property:** Many hotels offer this option. It’s a safe choice, but be prepared to pay with cash (Chinese
  Yuan) if they don't accept your international card.

## Practical Tips for a Smooth Stay

A little preparation goes a long way. These tips will help you avoid common issues.

### Save the Hotel Address in Chinese

GPS and ride-hailing apps work best with Chinese addresses. After booking, copy the hotel’s name and address in Chinese
characters. Save it in your phone’s notes or as a screenshot. This is incredibly helpful for showing to taxi drivers or
navigating.

### Contacting the Property

Use the in-app chat features on Booking.com, Agoda, or Trip.com for easy communication. For more direct contact, many
hotels list their WeChat ID. Adding them on WeChat can be useful for quick questions.

### Late Check-In Procedures

If you know you'll be arriving late (after 6 PM), inform the hotel. You can add a note during booking or send them a
message. This ensures they hold your room and don't mark you as a no-show.

### Registering with the Public Security Bureau (PSB)

By law, all foreigners must register their place of residence with the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) within 24
hours of arrival. When you stay at a licensed hotel, they handle this for you during check-in. They will scan your
passport and entry stamp, completing the registration on your behalf. This is a standard and routine process.

## What to Expect at Check-In

- **Present Your Passport:** The front desk staff will need the physical passports for every guest staying in the room.
- **Visa and Entry Stamp:** They will examine your Chinese visa and the entry stamp you received at the border.
- **Passport Scan:** They will take a photocopy or scan of your passport's photo page and your visa/entry stamp page for
  their records and PSB registration.
- **Deposit:** Be ready to pay the security deposit.

## Tips by City and Season

### City Tiers

- **Tier 1 Cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen):** You'll find a huge range of options, from hostels to
  luxury brands. Most hotels are accustomed to foreign guests, and international credit cards are widely accepted.
- **Smaller Cities (Tier 2, 3, and below):** The number of hotels licensed for foreigners decreases significantly. It is
  crucial to book on Trip.com and double-check eligibility. Have a backup plan and be prepared to pay with cash or a
  mobile payment app.

### Peak Travel Seasons

China has several major national holidays that cause travel demand—and hotel prices—to skyrocket.

- **Chinese New Year (Spring Festival):** Usually late January or February.
- **Golden Week:** The first week of October.
- **Canton Fair (Guangzhou):** Held twice a year in spring and autumn. Hotel prices in Guangzhou and nearby cities
  become extremely high.

Book hotels several months in advance if your travel dates overlap with these periods.

## Reading and Leaving Reviews

When reading reviews, look for comments from other international travelers. They often mention specifics about the ease
of check-in, language abilities of the staff, and payment options.

When you leave a review, consider including these helpful points for future travelers:

- Did they accept your foreign passport without issue?
- What payment methods worked for you (credit card, cash, Alipay)?
- Was the address easy to find?
- Did any staff members speak English?

## Quick Booking Checklist

1. **Search** on a reliable platform like Trip.com or Booking.com.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**What if a hotel turns me away even though I have a booking?**\
This almost always happens because the hotel is not licensed to host foreigners. Unfortunately, you will have to find
another hotel. Use a booking app to find a nearby hotel that is confirmed to accept foreigners and book it on the spot.

**My international credit card was declined. What should I do?**\
This can happen, especially at smaller hotels. The best solutions are to pay with cash (CNY) or use Alipay/WeChat Pay
linked to your international card. Always carry some emergency cash.

**What is a "fapiao" and do I need one?**\
A *fapiao* is an official paper receipt used for business expense claims in China. As a tourist, you do not need one.

**What's the difference between a "double room" and a "twin room"?**\
A "double room" has one large bed (e.g., a queen or king). A "twin room" has two separate single beds. Be sure to select
the correct room type for your needs.

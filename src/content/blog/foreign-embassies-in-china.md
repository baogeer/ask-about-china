## What Do Embassies and Consulates Do?

Embassies and consulates serve two primary functions, and it's important to know the difference:

1. **Services for Their Own Citizens Abroad:** This is their main role for foreigners in China. It includes assistance
   with passports, emergencies, birth registrations, and notarizing documents.
2. **Visa Services for Chinese Nationals:** They process visa applications for Chinese citizens who wish to travel to
   the embassy's home country. This is generally handled by a separate visa section or an outsourced visa application
   center.

This guide focuses on the first category: services for you as a foreign citizen in China.

## How to Find Your Embassy or Consulate

Your access to consular services depends on where you are in China. Each mission has a specific "consular district," or
geographic area, that it serves.

- **Embassies (Beijing):** Every country with diplomatic relations with China has its embassy in the capital, Beijing.
  The embassy in Beijing often serves the consular district covering northern China.

- **Consulates General (Other Cities):** To serve citizens across this vast country, many nations also operate
  consulates in major hubs. Common locations include:

    - **Shanghai:** Serving the eastern China region.
    - **Guangzhou:** Serving southern China.
    - **Chengdu or Chongqing:** Serving southwestern China.
    - **Shenyang:** Serving northeastern China.
    - **Wuhan:** Serving central China.
    - **Hong Kong and Macau SARs:** These are special administrative regions with their own consulates general that
      operate separately from those in mainland China.

**How do you know which one to contact?** You must contact the mission whose consular district you are physically in.
For example, if you are a U.S. citizen in Shanghai, you must go to the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai, not the
Embassy in Beijing, for services. Always check your government's official foreign affairs website to confirm the correct
location.

## Key Services for Foreign Citizens

Embassies and consulates are there to help you with specific official matters.

### What They CAN Do:

- **Passport Services:** Issue new passports, renew expired ones, and provide emergency travel documents if your
  passport is lost or stolen.

- **Notarial Services:** Witness signatures on official documents like affidavits or powers of attorney.

- **Registration of Births Abroad:** Document the birth of a child to its citizens in China, creating an official
  record.

- **Assistance in Emergencies:**

    - **Arrest:** Provide a list of local lawyers and visit detained citizens to ensure their welfare.
    - **Accidents or Medical Crises:** Help contact family members back home and provide information on local medical
      facilities.
    - **Victim Support:** Offer guidance and support to citizens who are victims of crime.

### What They CANNOT Do:

- Provide legal advice or represent you in court.
- Pay your medical bills, legal fees, or travel expenses.

- Find you employment or arrange travel plans.
- Store your luggage or act as a mailing address.

## Appointments and Visiting a Mission in 2025

You can't just show up at an embassy. Access is tightly controlled for security reasons.

- **Online Appointments:** Nearly all non-emergency services require an online appointment booked in advance through the
  mission's official website.

- **Security Screening:** Expect a rigorous security check, similar to an airport. You will be required to leave
  prohibited items like large bags, electronics (laptops, tablets), and liquids with security before entering.

- **What to Bring:**

    - Your passport and proof of citizenship.
    - Proof of your appointment.
    - Any required forms, completed but not signed.
    - Passport-sized photos that meet specific requirements.
    - Fees for the service, often payable by credit card or mobile payment (cash is becoming less common).

## Emergency Contacts in China

In a life-threatening situation, your first call should always be to local emergency services. Consulates coordinate
with them but are not first responders.

- **Local Police:** 110
- **Ambulance:** 120
- **Fire Department:** 119

After contacting local authorities, you or someone on your behalf should call your embassy or consulate's after-hours
emergency number. This number is for life-or-death situations involving a citizen, such as a death, arrest, or serious
medical crisis.

## Visas for Traveling Companions

If you are traveling with a Chinese national who needs a visa to visit your home country or elsewhere, they must apply
through the relevant embassy's visa section or its designated visa application center. As a foreign citizen, you
generally cannot assist with this process from within the consular services section. Refer them to the official visa
application website. For details on your own visa, see our guide on [**How to Apply for a Chinese Visa
**](/apply-for-chinese-visa).

## What if Your Country Has No Embassy in China?

If your home country does not have a diplomatic mission in China, consular assistance may be provided through a
pre-arranged agreement.

- **Protecting Power:** Another country's embassy may be designated as a "protecting power" to provide essential
  consular services to you.
- **Third-Country Representation:** Some nations have informal arrangements with friendly countries to help their
  citizens in emergencies.
- **Nearest Embassy:** You may need to contact your country's embassy in a neighboring country (e.g., South Korea,
  Japan, or Thailand) for support.

Check your foreign ministry's website *before you travel* to understand what arrangements are in place.

## Data Privacy and Practical Tips

- **Security and Device Policies:** Be prepared to turn off and store your phone when entering a mission. Photography is
  strictly forbidden.
- **Register Your Trip:** Before you go, register your travel plans with your foreign ministry's traveler program (e.g.,
  the U.S. Smart Traveler Enrollment Program - STEP). This allows the embassy to contact you in an emergency.
- **WeChat Official Accounts:** Many embassies have official WeChat accounts where they post updates and important
  notices.
- **Chinese Addresses:** Save your hotel and embassy addresses in Chinese characters on your phone to easily show taxi
  drivers. Our [**Guide to Internet Access in China**](/china-internet-access-guide) has more tips on useful apps.

## FAQ: Common Consular Questions

**Q: Is a document notarized by my embassy automatically valid in China?**\
A: Not always. Documents for use in China may require further legalization by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Check the requirements for your specific situation.

**Q: How long does it take to replace a lost passport?**\
A: An emergency travel document can often be issued in 1-3 business days. A full-validity replacement passport takes
much longer and may need to be mailed to you.

**Q: Can I bring my child with me to my appointment?**\
A: Minors are generally permitted to accompany a parent to an appointment, but extra companions or friends are usually
not allowed past security.

**Q: How do I pay for consular services?**\
A: Most missions now prefer cashless payments via international credit card or local mobile payment apps. Check the
embassy's website for accepted payment methods.

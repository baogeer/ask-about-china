## 1. Intercity Travel Overview: Train or Plane?

In China, the main ways to travel between cities are by train and plane. The right choice depends on your time, budget,
and destination.

- **High-Speed Rail (G/D/C Trains):** Fast, frequent, highly punctual, with stations often located in or near city
  centers. This is the top choice for the vast majority of short- to medium-haul (1-5 hours) intercity journeys,
  offering excellent value for money.
- **Conventional Trains (Z/T/K Trains):** Slower but significantly cheaper. They are especially good for overnight
  long-distance trips, as they can save you a night's accommodation cost.
- **Domestic Flights:** When your travel distance is very long (e.g., Beijing to Urumqi) or your destination lacks
  convenient rail access, flying is the best option. Booking in advance often brings discounts, but remember to factor
  in the time and cost of getting to and from the airport.

For most travelers, a strategy of "mainly high-speed rail, supplemented by flights" is the most efficient and economical
combination.

## 2. The Complete Guide to High-Speed Rail

Riding China's high-speed rail is a modern and comfortable experience. Mastering these key points will make your journey
even smoother.

### Booking Tickets and Choosing Seats

- **Booking Channels:** The official railway app (12306) is the primary choice, but it requires a Chinese phone number.
  For international travelers, using the English interface of third-party platforms like Trip.com is more convenient.

- **Booking Window:** Tickets are usually released 14 days before departure. For popular routes and during holidays, be
  sure to book as early as possible.

- **Seat Classes:**

    - **Second Class:** The best value and the most common choice, with a 3+2 seat layout.
    - **First Class:** More spacious with a 2+2 layout, suitable for travelers seeking extra comfort.
    - **Business Class:** Luxurious, fully-reclining seats with the highest price tag.

- **Seat Selection Tips:** Window seats are usually A and F, while aisle seats are C and D.

### The Boarding Process

1. **Ticket Collection/E-Tickets:** Currently, foreign passport holders can directly swipe their passports to enter the
   station on most routes, without needing to collect a paper ticket. It's wise to confirm this when booking or save a
   screenshot of your order for verification.
2. **Arriving at the Station:** Arrive at the station at least 60 minutes in advance. Chinese train stations are
   massive, and you'll need ample time to get through security and find your waiting area.
3. **Security and Waiting:** All luggage must pass through an X-ray security check. Afterward, find your designated
   waiting hall and gate number based on your ticket information.
4. **Boarding:** Boarding usually begins 15-20 minutes before departure and closes about 3-5 minutes before. Follow the
   crowd through the gate to your platform.
5. **Luggage Storage:** Small bags can be placed on the overhead rack. Large suitcases go in the dedicated luggage areas
   at the end of each car.

## 3. Conventional and Overnight Trains

Choosing a conventional train, especially an overnight one, is a great way to have an authentic experience and save
money.

### Sleeper Options

- **Soft Sleeper:** A cabin with four bunks and a closeable door, offering more privacy and comfort.
- **Hard Sleeper:** An open-plan compartment with six bunks (upper, middle, and lower). It's the most cost-effective
  sleeper option. The lower bunk offers the most space and allows you to sit up; the middle is next; the upper is the
  cheapest but has the least headroom.
- **Hard Seat:** The most economical seat, only recommended for short journeys (under 3 hours) and for travelers on an
  extremely tight budget.

### Overnight Travel Tips

- **Safety:** Keep your valuables (passport, cash, phone) on your person, especially when sleeping.
- **Food and Drink:** There is a dining car, and trolleys with snacks and drinks pass through regularly, but prices are
  higher. Many locals bring their own instant noodles; free hot water is available at the end of each car.
- **Comfort:** Pack earplugs and an eye mask to deal with nighttime lights and noise.

## 4. Urban Transport: Navigating the City Veins

The public transport systems in China's major cities are incredibly well-developed and are the best way to explore.

- **Metro/Subway:** The fastest and most convenient option. Station names and signs are usually in English. You can buy
  single-journey tickets from machines or use a transport card or a mobile app (Alipay/WeChat Pay QR code) to swipe in.

- **Public Bus:** The cheapest option, with fares typically at 1-2 CNY. However, routes can be complex and announcements
  are mostly in Chinese, making it challenging for newcomers.

- **Shared Bikes:** Perfect for short-distance exploration (under 3 km/2 miles), allowing you to discover alleys and
  streets inaccessible by subway.

- **Ride-Hailing and Taxis:**

    - **Ride-Hailing (e.g., Didi Chuxing):** Recommended. Prices are transparent, payment is handled online, and you can
      communicate simply with the driver via the app's built-in translation.
    - **Taxis:** Be sure to choose a licensed taxi and insist on using the meter ("by meter").

- **Airport/Train Station Connections:** The metro or a dedicated airport shuttle bus is the most economical and
  reliable way to travel between the city and transport hubs.

## 5. Ticketing and Payments

In China, convenient digital payments have permeated every aspect of travel.

- **Real-Name Ticketing:** All train and plane tickets must be purchased using your real name as it appears on your
  passport.

- **Digital Payments:** It is highly recommended to set up Alipay or WeChat Pay and link your international bank card.
  You can use it to:

    - Scan QR codes to ride subways and buses.
    - Pay for ride-hailing and taxis.
    - Buy tickets on third-party platforms or at ticket windows.

- **Connectivity:** A smooth digital payment experience depends on a stable internet connection. Preparing an eSIM or a
  local SIM card in advance is crucial. For specific setup instructions, refer to our [**guide to internet access in
  China**](/internet-access-in-china) and our [**expat SIM card guide**](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china).

## 6. Local Insider Tips

Mastering these details will make your travel experience feel just like a local's.

- **Avoid Rush Hour:** Try to avoid riding the subway during weekday morning and evening rush hours (approx. 7:30-9:00
  AM and 5:30-7:00 PM).
- **Identify Exits:** Subway station exits are marked with letters (A, B, C, D…) and list nearby landmarks. Check your
  map app beforehand to see which exit will save you the most walking.
- **Use Chinese Addresses:** When taking a taxi or asking for directions, showing the Chinese name and address of your
  destination is far more effective than describing it in English.
- **Offline Maps:** Download offline maps in advance and get familiar with searching for places using Pinyin (the
  official romanization system for Standard Chinese).
- **Boarding Etiquette:** Let people get off before you get on. In a crowded car, move toward the center to make room
  for others.

## 7. Safety and Compliance

While enjoying the convenient transport, always remain vigilant.

- **Refuse "Black Cabs" and Touts:** At train stations and airports, only wait for taxis at the official taxi stands.
  Ignore drivers who approach you directly. Don't buy overpriced tickets from unofficial channels.
- **Beware of Scams:** Be cautious of overly enthusiastic strangers who might try to lead you to a consumer trap under
  the guise of showing you the way or making a recommendation. For more examples, see our guide to the [**most common
  scams in Beijing**](/most-common-scams-in-beijing).
- **Accommodation Registration:** Remember that when you check into a hotel, they will complete the mandatory Public
  Security Bureau (PSB) registration for you. This is a fundamental part of a legal stay.

## 8. Seamless Connection to Your Accommodation

Smooth transportation ultimately serves to get you to your lodging.

- **Save the Chinese Address:** After booking, be sure to save a screenshot of your hotel's name and address in Chinese
  on your phone. This is the "universal language" to show taxi and ride-hailing drivers.
- **Notify for Late Arrival:** If you expect to arrive late at night, inform the hotel in advance to prevent your
  booking from being canceled.
- **Prepare for Payment:** Be ready with cash or a card to pay the security deposit.

These details are covered more thoroughly in our guide on [**How to Book a Hotel in China**](/).

## 9. Packing Smart for Travel

- **Streamline Luggage:** A small suitcase plus a backpack is the optimal combination, making it easy to move around
  train stations and subways.
- **Comfortable Shoes:** You will do a lot of walking.
- **Essential Accessories:** A power bank, noise-canceling headphones/earplugs, a thermos (free hot water is available
  at stations and on trains), and a foldable umbrella.
- **Clothing Note:** The air conditioning on trains and subways can be strong. It's a good idea to carry a light jacket,
  even in summer.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I select a window seat when booking a train ticket?**\
Yes. On most booking platforms, you can select "Window" or "Aisle." Seats A and F are typically window seats.

ticket is needed. However, it's wise to check the platform's prompts after booking, just in case.

**What are the luggage restrictions on Chinese trains?**\
Each passenger can carry luggage up to 20 kg (44 lbs) for free. The size limit (sum of length, width, and height) is

When you get out, you can ask the driver for a printed receipt ("Fāpiào"). For ride-hailing services, an electronic
receipt can be requested within the app.

**Is it convenient to travel with children or a stroller?**\
Very convenient. High-speed trains and subways have accessible routes and elevators, making it easy to use a stroller.
Many train cars also have dedicated space.

Yes. Stations have "Priority Channels," and on-train staff will provide assistance. You can ask them for priority
boarding or for help arranging a more convenient seat.

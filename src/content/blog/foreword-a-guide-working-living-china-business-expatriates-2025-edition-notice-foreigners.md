## II. Matters Requiring Special Attention

### (I) Validity period of visa

Foreigners who enter the Chinese mainland with a visa and plan to work and live in the Chinese mainland need to apply
for a residence permit within 30 days from the date of entry according to relevant requirements. If an extension of the
duration of stay specified in the visa is required, the application should be submitted to the exit and entry
administration authority of public security organs of local people's governments at or above the county level in the
place of residence, at least 7 days before the expiration of the duration of stay specified in the visa, with the
relevant materials relating to the purpose of the application.

### (II) Validity period of residence permit

Foreigners who need to stay in the Chinese mainland after the expiration of residence permits shall apply for an
extension 30 days before the expiration. Foreigners who hold a valid residence permit and have changed passports or had
other items on the residence permit changed shall apply to the exit and entry administration authority of public
security organs for information update within 10 days from the date the changes occur.

### (III) Validity period of work permit

1. Foreigners working within the Chinese mainland should obtain a foreigner's work permit. Foreigners with a working
   period not exceeding 30 days must adhere to the timeframe specified in their foreigner's work permit and stay in the
   country for the duration outlined on their Z visa. Those with a working period exceeding 30 days must also follow the
   timeframe specified in their foreigner's work permit and apply for a work-type residence permit, valid for 90 days.
   This application should be made with the local public security organ by presenting their foreigner's work permit, Z
   visa, and other supporting documents. Foreign art performance groups and individuals can complete residence
   procedures with the local public security organ at the location where the performance organizer is registered or
   where the first performance takes place, by presenting their foreigner's work permit, Z visa, and other supporting
   documents. Foreign performers who have obtained residence permits will not need to repeat these residence procedures
   when performing at other locations in the Chinese mainland.
2. The employer shall submit an application for an extension to the local administration department of foreigners
   working in the Chinese mainland 30 days before the expiration of the work permit.
3. In case of any change in personal information (name, passport number, and position), an application for changes shall
   be submitted to the administration department of foreigners working in the Chinese mainland in the place where the
   employer is located within 10 working days from the date the changes occur.

### (IV) Others

1. Foreigners must abide by the laws and regulations of China when writing comments on social media in China.
2. Foreigners must comply with relevant regulations when keeping dogs, cats, and other pets.
3. Foreigners must not photograph military installations, including buildings, sites, and facilities directly used by
   China for military purposes.

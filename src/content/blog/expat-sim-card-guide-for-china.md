Navigating China’s mobile network for the first time can feel complex, but it doesn't have to be. Whether you're a
tourist on a short trip or an expat setting up a new life, getting connected is essential. This guide provides clear,
practical steps to help you get a local SIM card, understand the mobile networks, and stay connected hassle-free
throughout your time in China.

## Why You Need a Local China SIM Card

Using your home country's SIM card for international roaming in China can lead to surprisingly high bills for calls and
data. A local SIM card offers a much more affordable way to access high-speed internet and make calls.

More importantly, a Chinese phone number is a key that unlocks modern life in China. Many essential apps and
services—from ride-hailing and food delivery to mobile payments and online shopping—require a local number for
registration and verification. Without one, you'll find it difficult to use the digital conveniences that make daily
life and travel so efficient here.

## How to Get and Activate a SIM Card in China

In China, all SIM cards are subject to a real-name registration policy. This is a straightforward process, but it
requires you to present your original, valid passport.

**Where to Buy a SIM Card:**

- **Official Carrier Stores:** This is the most reliable option. Stores for China Mobile, China Unicom, and China
  Telecom are found in every city. Staff can help you select a suitable plan and complete the registration process on
  the spot.
- **Airport Counters:** Major international airports like those in Beijing (PEK) and Shanghai (PVG) have carrier kiosks
  in the arrivals hall. While slightly more expensive, they offer immediate convenience for tourists.
- **Online and Third-Party Sellers:** Some services allow you to purchase a SIM card online before you travel. While
  convenient, ensure the provider is reputable and can handle the real-name registration process correctly. Buying from
  small, unofficial street vendors is not recommended, as you risk getting an improperly registered or invalid card.

**The Activation Process:**

1. Visit an official store with your passport.
2. Explain your needs (e.g., a short-term plan for a tourist or a monthly plan for an expat).
3. Choose a phone number and a data plan.
4. The staff will take a photo of you and scan your passport to complete the real-name registration.
5. Pay for the SIM card and plan. The staff will typically help you insert and activate it in your phone.

## Available SIM Card Types

### Physical SIM Cards

This is the most common and recommended option for foreigners in China. They come in the standard three sizes (Standard,
Micro, and Nano) to fit any device. When you purchase your card, the staff will provide the correct size for your phone.

### eSIM in Mainland China

While eSIM technology is growing globally, its availability for foreign visitors in mainland China is still limited.
Currently, eSIMs are primarily offered by carriers like China Unicom for specific cellular-enabled devices like
smartwatches. Tourists will find it much easier and more reliable to get a physical SIM card upon arrival.

## Choosing the Best SIM Card for Tourists

For short-term visitors, a prepaid plan with a generous data allowance is usually the best choice. These plans often
include a small amount of calling credit and are designed for convenience.

**Key Factors to Consider:**

- **Length of Stay:** Choose a plan that matches your trip's duration. Carriers offer 7-day, 15-day, 30-day, and 90-day
  prepaid options.

- **Data Needs:** If you plan to use maps, social media, and translation apps frequently, a plan with at least 20-40 GB
  of data is a safe bet.

- **Carrier Network:** All three major carriers offer great service in cities, but there are slight differences.

    - **China Mobile:** Has the most extensive network coverage in China, especially in rural and remote areas. Its
      4G/5G bands might have compatibility issues with some older international phones.
    - **China Unicom:** Widely considered the most foreigner-friendly choice because its network bands are highly
      compatible with most international smartphones.
    - **China Telecom:** Offers excellent network quality and competitive pricing in urban centers, but like China
      Mobile, its network might not be fully compatible with all foreign devices.

## Understanding China’s Mobile Network

China has a world-class mobile infrastructure with widespread 5G coverage in all major cities. To ensure your phone
works correctly, you need to check two things before you leave home.

### Phone Compatibility

First, your phone must be **unlocked**. An unlocked phone is not tied to a specific carrier and can accept a SIM card
from any network. Contact your current provider to confirm your phone's status if you are unsure.

Second, check if your phone supports China's primary 4G (LTE) and 5G frequency bands. Most modern smartphones from major
international brands will work without issue, but it's always good to verify. The key LTE bands are 1, 3, 5, 8, and the
TDD-LTE bands 38, 39, 40, and 41.

## International Roaming vs. a Local SIM

If you decide to use your home SIM card, contact your carrier before your trip to understand their international roaming
charges and packages. Roaming is often very expensive, and your data speeds may be throttled. A local SIM is almost
always the more practical and cost-effective solution.

## Setting Up Your Phone in China

Once you insert your new Chinese SIM card, most phones will automatically detect the network settings. If you can make
calls but cannot access the internet, you may need to set the APN (Access Point Name) manually.

- **APN Settings:** You can find this in your phone’s settings, usually
  under `Settings > Cellular > Cellular Data Network`. The APN name varies by carrier (e.g., `3gnet` for China Unicom).
  The store staff can help you with this, or you can find the correct setting with a quick online search.
- **Tethering/Personal Hotspot:** Using your phone as a personal hotspot to share your data connection with a laptop or
  another device is allowed and works just as it does in other countries.

## Data Plans and Topping Up

Chinese carriers offer a wide variety of affordable data plans. If you run out of data, it’s easy to add more.

**How to Recharge (Top Up):**

- **WeChat Pay or Alipay:** This is the most common method. Both apps have a "Mobile Top-up" feature where you can enter
  your phone number and recharge instantly.
- **Official Carrier Apps:** Download your carrier's official app (e.g., China Unicom App) to manage your account, check
  your balance, and purchase data add-ons.
- **Carrier Stores:** You can always visit an official store to top up your account with cash or a card.

## Staying Connected: Essential Apps

With your new Chinese phone number, you can register for WeChat and Alipay. These "super apps" are central to daily life
in China, integrating social messaging, mobile payments, booking taxis, ordering food, and more.

## Internet Access for Foreigners

It is important to know that many international websites and apps, including Google services (Gmail, Maps), Facebook,
Instagram, and X (formerly Twitter), are blocked in mainland China. To access them, you will need a reliable VPN (
Virtual Private Network). Research and set up a VPN service *before* you arrive in China, as downloading VPN apps can be
difficult once you are there.

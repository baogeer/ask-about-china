Getting connected in China with a local SIM card and setting up mobile payments can feel like a complex puzzle. But it's
easier than you think and completely transforms your travel experience. With a local number, you can access high-speed
data, make calls, and unlock the world of digital payments with Alipay and WeChat Pay. This guide provides everything
you need to know, from choosing a carrier to troubleshooting common issues.

We’ll walk you through purchasing a SIM card, navigating the mandatory real-name registration, and linking your foreign
credit card to China’s top payment apps.

### Key Takeaways

- **Passport Required:** You must use your passport for real-name registration to buy any SIM card in China.
- **Three Main Carriers:** Your choices are China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom. All offer reliable service,
  especially in major cities.
- **Mobile Payments are King:** Alipay and WeChat Pay are essential. You can link your international Visa or Mastercard
  to use them.
- **eSIMs are an Option:** Travel eSIMs are convenient for short trips, while local eSIMs are becoming more available.

## Choosing a Chinese Mobile Carrier

China has three state-owned mobile carriers. For travelers visiting major cities, the differences are minor, but here’s
a quick breakdown.

- **China Mobile (中国移动):** The largest network with the best overall coverage, especially in rural and remote areas.
  If you plan to travel off the beaten path, this is often the safest bet.
- **China Unicom (中国联通):** Known for fast 4G/5G speeds in urban centers and generally good compatibility with
  foreign phones. Historically considered more "international-friendly," though this gap has narrowed.
- **China Telecom (中国电信):** Offers competitive speeds and coverage, particularly in southern China. It sometimes
  uses different network bands, so check your phone’s compatibility if considering this option.

All three carriers provide widespread 4G LTE and rapidly expanding 5G networks in urban areas. Voice over LTE (VoLTE) is
standard, ensuring clear calls.

## Where to Buy a SIM Card in China

You have several options for purchasing a prepaid SIM card. Prices and packages vary, but expect to pay between ¥100 to
¥300 for a package with a generous amount of data (e.g., 20-40 GB) and some local call minutes, valid for 30 days.

### Airport Kiosks

- **Pros:** Most convenient option upon arrival. Staff often speak some English and are familiar with selling to
  foreigners.
- **Cons:** Can be more expensive than city stores. Choices may be limited to specific tourist packages.

### Official Carrier Stores (营业厅)

- **Pros:** The most reliable source with the best prices and plan options. Staff can handle any activation issues on
  the spot.
- **Cons:** Located in the city, not at the airport. Language barriers can be a challenge; have a translation app ready.

### Electronics Retailers & Malls

- Some large electronics stores or mobile phone vendor booths in malls sell SIM cards. Their legitimacy and pricing can
  vary, so it’s best to stick to official carrier stores if possible.

### What You'll Need to Bring

- **Your Passport:** This is non-negotiable. The original document is required.
- **Address in China:** The name and address of your hotel.
- **Payment:** Cash (CNY), or they may accept Alipay/WeChat Pay if you already have it set up.

## The Real-Name Registration Process

China legally requires every mobile number to be linked to a real person's identity. This is a standard and
straightforward process for foreigners.

1. **Present Your Passport:** The staff will take a photocopy or scan of your passport’s photo page and your current
   Chinese visa/entry stamp page.
2. **Face Scan:** You will be asked to look into a camera or tablet for a quick facial scan to match your face with your
   passport photo.
3. **Sign Documents:** You’ll sign a service agreement form.

Activation is usually instant or takes less than an hour. Before leaving the store, insert the SIM card and confirm that
you have a signal and can access data.

## Using an eSIM in China

eSIMs offer a convenient, physical-card-free way to get connected.

- **Travel eSIMs:** Services like Airalo, Nomad, or Holafly sell data-only eSIMs for China. You can buy and install them
  before your trip. This is great for short-term visitors who primarily need data.
- **Local Carrier eSIMs:** Acquiring a local eSIM with a Chinese phone number directly from a carrier store is becoming
  more common but isn't guaranteed everywhere. You’ll still need to go through the same in-person passport registration
  process.

**Dual-SIM Strategy:** A popular approach is to use a travel eSIM for data while keeping your home country's physical
SIM in your phone for receiving calls or texts. Alternatively, use a physical Chinese SIM for data/calls and your home
country’s number on an eSIM.

**Device Compatibility:** Ensure your phone is unlocked and supports eSIM technology before purchasing one.

## Activating and Managing Your SIM Card

### Initial Setup

1. **Insert the SIM/Activate eSIM:** Power off your phone, insert the new SIM, and power it back on.
2. **Enable Data:** Turn on mobile data in your phone's settings.
3. **Check APN Settings:** The Access Point Name (APN) should configure automatically. If you have no data, check your
   settings. Common APNs are `cmnet` (China Mobile) or `3gnet` (China Unicom). You can usually find the correct one on
   the SIM card packaging.
4. **Enable VoLTE:** Ensure Voice over LTE is enabled for better call quality.

### Checking Your Balance and Topping Up

You can check your balance or remaining data through:

- **USSD Codes:** Dialing a short code (ask the carrier for this).
- **Carrier Apps:** Each carrier has an app, though it's often in Chinese.
- **WeChat/Alipay:** Both apps have sections for topping up your phone credit ("Mobile Top Up"). This is the easiest
  method once you have mobile payments set up.
- **In-Store:** Visit any official carrier store or convenience store to add credit with cash.

Keep your line active by ensuring it has a positive balance. A zero balance for an extended period can lead to
deactivation. For more on staying connected, see

## Enabling WeChat Pay & Alipay with Foreign Cards

Linking your international credit card to Alipay or WeChat Pay allows you to pay for nearly everything in China by
scanning a QR code.

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Download the App:** Get Alipay (支付宝) and WeChat (微信) from your app store.

2. **Sign Up:** Create an account. You can use your foreign mobile number.

3. **Identity Verification (Real-Name Authentication):**

    - In the app’s wallet or payment section, find the option to add a bank card.
    - You will be prompted to complete identity verification.
    - Select your nationality, and enter your full name (exactly as on your passport), passport number, and other
      required details. You may need to upload a photo of your passport.

4. **Add Your Card:**

    - Enter your international credit card details (Visa, Mastercard, etc.).
    - Your bank may send you a verification code (3D Secure) to authorize the link.

**Note:** There are transaction limits for foreign cards, and not every small vendor can accept payments from them, but
they work at most hotels, restaurants, and shops. Ensure your name in the app perfectly matches your passport and bank
records to avoid declines.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

- **SIM Not Activating:** Return to the store where you bought it. The registration may not have been completed
  correctly.
- **No Data Connection:** Check that mobile data is on and your APN settings are correct. Toggling airplane mode on and
  off can also help.
- **Can’t Receive Verification SMS:** This can happen if your plan doesn't include messaging or if there's a network
  issue. Try restarting your phone. This is crucial for setting up other apps.
- **Payment Fails on Alipay/WeChat Pay:** Ensure your linked card has sufficient funds and that you've enabled
  international transactions with your bank. Re-verifying your identity in the app can also resolve issues.

## Practical Use Cases for Your Chinese SIM

With data and payments sorted, you can:

- **Hail Rides:** Use Didi Chuxing (China’s Uber) to get around easily.
- **Navigate:** Use Baidu Maps or Apple Maps, which work well in China.
- **Translate:** Use translation apps to communicate with locals.
- **Order Food:** Use Meituan or Ele.me for food delivery.
- **Stay Safe:** Being connected helps you avoid tricky situations. Learn more in our guide
  to [Most Common Scams in Beijing](/most-common-scams-in-beijing).

## Final Tips

- **Peak Seasons:** During holidays like Chinese New Year or Golden Week, airport kiosks can be busy. Consider buying
  your SIM in the city to save time.
- **Legal Compliance:** Having a registered SIM and using it for check-ins is part of staying compliant. Learn more in

## Quick Booking Checklist

2. **Choose a Carrier:** China Mobile for rural coverage, China Unicom for city speeds.
3. **Prepare Your Passport:** Have your physical passport ready for registration.
4. **Buy at the Airport or a City Store:** Go to an official carrier store for the best results.
5. **Complete Real-Name Registration:** Let them scan your passport and your face.
6. **Test the SIM:** Before leaving the store, confirm you have data and a signal.
7. **Download Alipay & WeChat:** Get the apps on your phone.
8. **Verify Your Identity:** Use your passport to complete real-name authentication in the apps.
9. **Link Your Foreign Credit Card:** Add your Visa or Mastercard to the wallet.
10. **Top Up as Needed:** Use Alipay, WeChat, or a local convenience store to add credit.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I use my home SIM card in China?**\
Yes, if you enable international roaming. However, it is usually extremely expensive for both data and calls. A local
SIM is far more cost-effective.

**Do I need a VPN with a Chinese SIM card?**\
A Chinese SIM card gives you access to the Chinese internet. To access blocked international sites and apps like Google,
Facebook, and Instagram, you will still need a reliable VPN.

**What happens if my number gets deactivated?**\
This usually happens due to a zero balance for 1-2 months. You'll need to visit a carrier store with your passport to
reactivate it or get a new number.

**Can I tether or use my phone as a hotspot?**\
Yes, most prepaid plans allow you to use your phone as a personal hotspot to share data with other devices.

**How much data do I need?**\
For a typical two-week trip involving maps, social media, and light browsing, 20-30GB is usually more than enough.

**Do I need to speak Chinese to buy a SIM card?**\
It helps, but it’s not essential. At airports and in major city centers, staff often have experience with foreign
customers. Using a translation app on your phone can bridge any communication gaps.

Getting connected is the first step to a smooth and immersive journey in China. With a local SIM and mobile payments,
you’ll be ready to navigate the country like a local.

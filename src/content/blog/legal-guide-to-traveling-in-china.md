and trouble-free trip. This guide provides a clear overview of laws and regulations for foreign tourists planning a
visit in 2025, helping you navigate your travels with confidence and avoid unnecessary complications.

## **Framework of the Legal System**

China‚Äôs legal system is based on civil law, with the **Constitution of the People's Republic of China** as its supreme
authority. National legislative power is held by the National People's Congress (NPC) and its Standing Committee, while
the **State Council** is responsible for issuing administrative regulations and enforcing laws.  
For more details, visit the official English site of the [National People's Congress](http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc).

Tourists should note that China's laws have a clear hierarchical structure, and all levels‚Äîfrom national laws to local
regulations‚Äîmust be obeyed.

in fines or deportation.

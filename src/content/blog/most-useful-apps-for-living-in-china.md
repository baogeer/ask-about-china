Moving to China means entering a completely different digital world. Familiar apps like Google Maps, WhatsApp, and Uber
are replaced by powerful, all-in-one "super apps" that manage every aspect of daily life. From ordering a coffee and
paying your utility bills to booking a doctor's appointment and hailing a taxi, everything happens within a handful of
applications. Mastering this ecosystem is the single most important step you can take toward a smooth, convenient life
in China.

This guide is your essential roadmap to the most useful apps for expats, students, and long-term visitors in 2025. We'll
break down the must-haves for payments, navigation, food delivery, and more, helping you get set up and live like a
local from day one.

## 1. Understanding China's Super-App Ecosystem

Unlike the West, where we use dozens of single-purpose apps, China's digital landscape is dominated by a few giants like
WeChat and Alipay. These aren't just apps; they are platforms that host millions of "mini-programs"—apps within an app.
This means you can book a train ticket, order groceries, or rent a bike without ever leaving WeChat.

It's a closed but incredibly efficient system. Most apps are available through standard international app stores (like
Apple's App Store or Google Play), but some Android-specific apps may need to be downloaded from local Chinese app
stores (like the Huawei AppGallery or Tencent Appstore).

## 2. Connectivity Prerequisites: Getting Started

Before you can download and use these apps effectively, you need to sort out your digital foundation.

- **A Reliable SIM or eSIM:** You need a local Chinese phone number or a robust travel eSIM for data. Your home
  country's roaming plan will be slow and expensive. Check out our [**expat SIM card guide for China
  **](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china) for detailed options.
- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):** The "Great Firewall" blocks many international services, including Google (and its
  Play Store), Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. A reliable VPN is essential for accessing these services and staying
  connected with friends and family back home. Our guide on [**internet access in China**](/internet-access-in-china)
  covers this in depth.
- **App Store Region:** For iPhone users, your home country's App Store will work fine for downloading most of these
  apps. For Android users, if you rely on the Google Play Store, you'll need a VPN active to access it.

## 3. The Titans: Messaging & Payments

These two apps are non-negotiable. You cannot function effectively in China without them.

### WeChat (微信, Wēixìn)

WeChat is the operating system for life in China. It's your primary messaging tool, social media platform, and digital
wallet.

- **Setup:** Download and register with your phone number. New international users may need a "security verification"
  from an existing WeChat user to activate their account.

- **Key Features:**

    - **Chats:** Your main communication tool for friends, colleagues, and even your landlord.
    - **Moments:** A social feed similar to a Facebook timeline where you can share photos and updates.
    - **WeChat Pay:** The integrated wallet for all your daily transactions.
    - **Mini-Programs:** Access services like Didi (ride-hailing), Meituan (food delivery), and JD.com (shopping)
      directly within WeChat.

### Alipay (支付宝, Zhīfùbǎo)

While WeChat integrates payments into a social app, Alipay is a dedicated financial powerhouse. It's often preferred for
larger transactions and more complex financial tasks.

- **Setup:** As an international user, you can download the app and link your foreign bank card (Visa, Mastercard, etc.)
  after completing a "real-name verification" with your passport.

- **Key Features:**

    - **Payments:** Its primary function. Use it everywhere, from street markets to department stores.
    - **Transport Codes:** Generate QR codes for subways and buses in most major cities.
    - **Bill Payments:** Pay utility bills, top up your phone credit, and more.
    - **Higher Limits:** Generally offers higher transaction limits for tourists and foreign cardholders compared to
      WeChat Pay.

For a complete walkthrough, our [**guide to using mobile payments in China**](/how-to-use-mobile-payments-in-china) is a
must-read.

## 4. Maps & Navigation: Never Get Lost Again

Google Maps is blocked and provides inaccurate data in China. You need a local alternative.

### Amap (高德地图, Gāodé Dìtú)

Owned by Alibaba, Amap is arguably the most popular and accurate navigation app. It has a functional English interface,
making it the top choice for foreigners.

- **Features:** Real-time traffic updates, public transit planning with wait times, walking and cycling routes, and
  integration with services like ride-hailing.

### Baidu Maps (百度地图, Bǎidù Dìtú)

The main competitor to Amap, Baidu Maps is also excellent but has a less comprehensive English interface. It excels at
hyper-local details and points of interest.

- **Features:** Similar to Amap, with detailed indoor maps for malls and airports.

**Pro Tip:** Download offline city maps within these apps. This is a lifesaver if you lose your data connection while
exploring.

## 5. Getting Around: Ride-Hailing & Transport

China's public transport is world-class, and apps make it incredibly easy to use.

### Didi Chuxing (滴滴出行, Dīdī Chūxíng)

Didi is the equivalent of Uber and is the dominant ride-hailing app.

- **How it Works:** Set your pickup and destination (you can type in English or pinyin). Choose from various service
  levels, from express cars to premier vehicles. Payment is handled automatically through your linked Alipay or WeChat
  Pay account.
- **Safety:** The app includes safety features like sharing your trip status with emergency contacts.

### Public Transport

Forget buying physical tickets. Use the transport QR codes built into Alipay or WeChat. Simply open the app, find the
transit code for your city, and scan it at the turnstiles to enter and exit the subway or pay on a bus. Our [**guide to
transportation in China**](/transportation-in-china) explains this in detail.

### High-Speed Rail

For booking train tickets, use the official **Railway 12306** app. It has an English version, but many expats find it
easier to book through mini-programs within Alipay or via third-party apps like Trip.com.

## 6. Food & Groceries: Your Personal Kitchen

Food delivery is a way of life in China—it's fast, cheap, and incredibly convenient.

### Meituan (美团) & Ele.me (饿了么)

These are the two giants of food and grocery delivery.

- **What They Do:** Deliver meals from nearly any restaurant imaginable, often within 30 minutes. They also deliver
  groceries, medicine, coffee, and even electronics from local stores.
- **How to Use:** Browse restaurants, add items to your cart, and check out using Alipay or WeChat Pay. The apps have
  picture menus, making it easy to order even if you can't read Chinese. Look for filters to specify dietary needs
  like "vegetarian" (素食).
- **Contactless Delivery:** Most deliveries can be left at your door or with your building's receptionist for a fully
  contactless experience.

## 7. E-commerce & Daily Essentials

From electronics to clothing to furniture, everything can be bought online and delivered quickly.

### Taobao (淘宝) & Tmall (天猫)

Run by Alibaba, Taobao is the world's largest e-commerce platform, a vast marketplace for anything and everything. Tmall
is its sister site, focusing on official brand storefronts.

### JD.com (京东)

JD is known for its incredibly fast, self-operated logistics network. It's the go-to for electronics and appliances,
often offering same-day or next-day delivery.

### Pinduoduo (拼多多)

A newer player famous for its "group buying" model, where you get lower prices by joining with others to buy in bulk.
It's great for groceries, household goods, and finding incredible bargains.

---

## 8. Social & Content: The Digital Zeitgeist

### Weibo (微博)

China's equivalent of X (formerly Twitter). It's where news breaks, trends are born, and public figures engage with
their audience.

### Xiaohongshu (小红书, RED)

Often described as a mix of Instagram and Pinterest, RED is a visual-first platform focused on lifestyle, fashion,
beauty, and travel. It's a fantastic resource for finding trendy restaurants, travel spots, and product reviews.

### Douyin (抖音) & Bilibili (哔哩哔哩)

Douyin is the original Chinese version of TikTok, dominating the short-video space. Bilibili is a long-form video
platform similar to YouTube, popular for its user-generated content, anime, and extensive commenting culture.

## 9. Lifestyle, Travel & Utilities

- **Dianping (大众点评):** The Yelp of China. Use it to find reviews and ratings for restaurants, spas, gyms, and more.
  It's integrated into Meituan.
- **Trip.com (携程, Ctrip):** The leading app for booking domestic flights, hotels, and train tickets. It's
  foreigner-friendly with an excellent English interface. For hotel bookings, see our tips in [**How to Book a Hotel in
  China**](/).
- **Pleco:** The best all-in-one Chinese dictionary, document reader, and flashcard system. An essential tool for any
  language learner.

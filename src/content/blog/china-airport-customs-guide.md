## Arriving in China: The Entry Process Explained

After your international flight lands, follow these steps to complete your entry formalities.

### Step 1: Health Declaration and Entry Preparation

Before landing, complete any required health declaration forms as instructed by your airline or the port of entry. At
the same time, prepare your travel documents, which primarily include:

- Your original passport and a valid visa (or proof of visa-free eligibility)
- A completed arrival card (if required)

### Step 2: Clear Immigration, Then Claim Baggage

First, you will need to line up at an immigration (border control) counter, where an officer will check your passport
and visa to process your entry. After clearing immigration, proceed to the corresponding baggage carousel to retrieve
your checked luggage.

### Step 3: Choose Your Customs Channel

After collecting your baggage, you will arrive at the Customs inspection area. There are typically two channels, and you
must choose one based on the items you are carrying:

- **Green Channel**: Choose this channel if you are not carrying any declarable goods and the total value of your items
  is within the duty-free allowance.
- **Red Channel**: Proactively choose this channel if you are carrying items that must be declared. Present the "Baggage
  Declaration Form for Inbound/Outbound Passengers of the Customs of the People's Republic of China" or make a verbal
  declaration to a Customs officer.

## Entry Declarations: What Items Need Attention?

Proactive declaration is the best way to avoid fines and delays. The following are common categories of items that
require special attention upon entry:

- **Large Amounts of Currency**: Carrying cash or equivalent negotiable instruments that exceed the prescribed limit.
- **High-Value Items Beyond Reasonable Personal Use**: For example, multiple new laptops, cameras, drones, or other
  goods not intended for personal use.
- **Goods for Commercial Sale**: Items brought in for resale or commercial purposes, such as luxury goods or product
  samples.
- **Animals, Plants, and Their Products**: Bringing in fresh fruits, meats, seeds, or plants, which are often under
  strict control.
- **Restricted Items**: Such as pharmaceuticals in quantities exceeding reasonable personal use, as well as certain
  publications or audiovisual products.
- **Professional Equipment**: Carrying professional-grade photography or video equipment, or scientific instruments not
  intended for personal use.

### About Duty-Free Allowances

For regular inbound travelers, Customs has established certain duty-free allowances. Generally, a reasonable quantity of
personal effects acquired abroad for your own use (such as clothing, cosmetics, and one personal electronic device) does
not need to be declared.

**Helpful Tip**: It's a good practice to keep receipts for high-value items. When entering, place them in an easily
accessible spot in case of a Customs inspection.

## Leaving China: The Exit Process and Tax Refunds

The departure process is just as clear, especially for travelers who need to process a tax refund. Be sure to allow
plenty of extra time.

### Step 1: Check-in and Baggage Drop

Proceed to your airline's counter to check in for your flight and drop off your baggage. Note that airlines have strict
rules for transporting lithium batteries, power banks, and liquids.

**Crucial Reminder: If you plan to claim a tax refund, do not pack your purchased items in your checked luggage before
completing Customs validation.**

### Step 2: Customs Validation (for Tax Refunds)

This is the most critical step for getting your tax refund. Before checking your luggage, you need to find the "Customs
Validation" counter at the airport.

- Present the following to the Customs officer: your **passport**, **boarding pass** (or itinerary), the completed **Tax
  Refund Application Form**, and the **purchased, unused goods**.
- The Customs officer may inspect the items to ensure they are in their original condition and unused. After
  verification, the officer will stamp your application form. You cannot get a refund without this official stamp.

### Step 3: Security, Immigration, and Receiving Your Refund

After completing Customs validation, you can proceed through security and exit immigration. Once in the international
departure hall, find the designated "Tax Refund Counter" or self-service kiosk. Submit your stamped Tax Refund
Application Form, and you can choose to receive your refund in cash or as a credit to your bank card.

## Pre-Departure Preparation: Packing and Document Checklist

To ensure a smooth process, check that you have the following items ready before you leave for the airport:

- Original passport and visa (or proof of visa-free eligibility)
- Boarding pass or e-ticket itinerary
- All original purchase receipts and completed Tax Refund Application Forms (if applicable)
- Any permits for special items (e.g., a cultural relic export license)
- Keep tax refund goods and other high-value items in your carry-on or in an easily accessible place for Customs
  inspection.

## Common Scenarios and Recommended Actions

- **Carrying Multiple Electronics**: A combination of one personal-use laptop and one camera is usually fine. However,
  carrying multiple new, unopened units of the same product may be considered commercial use. It is recommended to
  declare them proactively at the Red Channel.
- **Exiting with Luxury Goods**: Keep your purchase receipts. If you wish to claim a tax refund for these items, do not
  use them before departure and keep the original packaging intact for Customs inspection.
- **Domestic Connection Before an International Flight**: You should complete your Customs validation procedures at your
  final port of departure from Mainland China (e.g., if you fly from Xi'an to Shanghai, and then from Shanghai to New
  York, you would complete validation at Shanghai Pudong Airport).

### Time-Saving Tips

- During peak travel seasons, arrive at the airport early to allow sufficient time for Customs validation and tax refund
  procedures.
- Keep all important documents (passport, boarding pass, refund forms) together in one folder and ensure the name and
  passport number match exactly across all forms.
- When shopping at a "Tax Refund" designated store, you can ask the staff to help you check that your Tax Refund
  Application Form is filled out completely and accurately.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

- **Do I need to declare gifts I'm bringing for others?**\
  If the value of the gifts exceeds the duty-free allowance or if they are restricted items, you need to go to the Red
  Channel to declare them.
- **Can a friend traveling with me carry my tax refund items?**\
  No. The person named on the Tax Refund Application Form must be the one carrying the goods and personally departing
  the country.
- **Is it possible to get a partial refund for items on one application form?**\
  Typically, the refund applies to the entire validated application form. Partial refunds are not supported.
- **What if I've already packed my tax refund items in my checked luggage?**\
  Absolutely do not check your tax refund items before completing Customs validation. You must be able to present the
  physical goods to the Customs officer.

## How Foreign Tourists Can Spot Fake RMB: Official Features and Practical On-the-Go Tips

While mobile payments are increasingly common, cash remains essential in certain situations. To help travelers avoid the
risk of receiving counterfeit currency, financial experts and tourism operators have released a series of practical
tips, centered on a simple "six-step quick check" to ensure a worry-free journey.

## **Background**

The currency currently in circulation in China is the fifth series of the Renminbi (RMB). Among the various
denominations, larger bills like the ¥50 and ¥100 notes are the most frequent targets for counterfeiters. For foreign
tourists unfamiliar with the currency, high-traffic transaction environments such as taxis, small shops, or night
markets can present a risk of encountering fake bills. Understanding the security features of the RMB beforehand is a
crucial preventative measure.

## **The Six-Step Quick Check**

You can quickly verify the authenticity of an RMB note by following these six simple steps:

1. **Check the Watermark (水印):** Hold the note up to the light. A clear, three-dimensional portrait of Mao Zedong
   should be visible in the blank space on the right side of the bill.
2. **Examine the Color-Shifting Numeral:** Observe the denomination number on the front of ¥100 and ¥50 notes. When you
   tilt a ¥100 bill, the number "100" will change from green to blue. On a ¥50 bill, the number will shift from gold to
   green.
3. **Feel the Raised Print and Texture:** Authentic RMB notes are made from a special cotton-fiber paper that feels
   slightly rough to the touch. The portrait of Mao Zedong, the bank's name, the national emblem, and the denomination
   numbers all have a distinct raised, tactile feel.
4. **Find the Security Thread (安全线):** A metallic security thread is embedded within the banknote. This thread will
   change color when the note is tilted. On counterfeit bills, the "thread" is often just printed on the surface and
   will not change color.
5. **Look for Microprinting:** Using a magnifying glass, you can see that the micro-printed text and numbers on a
   genuine note are sharp and complete. On fakes, this microprinting is often blurry or illegible.
6. **Verify the UV Features:** Under an ultraviolet (UV) light, authentic notes will reveal special fluorescent patterns
   and fibers. Counterfeit bills either lack these features or have an abnormal fluorescent glow.

> 🧭 Tip: If you're unsure about a note, compare it with one withdrawn directly from a **bank ATM**. The difference in
> texture and print quality is usually obvious.

## **High-Risk Travel Scenarios and How to Respond**

Being aware of common scams can help you stay vigilant:

- **The Taxi "Bill-Switch":** Some dishonest drivers may quickly swap your genuine note for a fake one when you pay,
  then claim you gave them a counterfeit bill.  
  **Response:** Verify your banknote before handing it over, try to pay with smaller denominations, and pay attention to
  the driver’s hands during the transaction. See also [Most Common Scams in Beijing](/most-common-scams-in-beijing).
- **Change at Night Markets and Small Stalls:** When paying with a large bill, there is a higher risk of receiving fake
  notes in your change.  
  **Response:** Check each note you receive on the spot before you walk away.
- **Illegal Street Exchanges:** Unofficial money changers may offer attractive exchange rates but are highly likely to
  give you fake bills or shortchange you.  
  **Response:** Only exchange currency at **official banks** or licensed money exchange offices.

For official bank exchange locations, you can
consult [Bank of China’s branch locator](https://www.boc.cn/en/aboutboc/ab7).

## **Payment and Cash Tips for Tourists**

- **Prioritize Electronic Payments:** Whenever possible, use international versions
  of [WeChat Pay](https://pay.weixin.qq.com/index.php/public/wechatpay_en) or [Alipay](https://www.alipay.com/global).
  This is the
  most effective way to minimize handling cash.
- **Withdraw from Bank ATMs:** Get your cash directly from ATMs at reputable banks such as ICBC, Bank of China, or CCB.
- **Carry Small Denominations:** For daily expenses, use smaller notes like ¥10 and ¥20 bills to reduce disputes.
- **Inspect Cash Immediately:** Whether it's change from a merchant or cash from an exchange, inspect the notes as soon
  as you receive them.

## **What to Do If You Receive a Counterfeit**

If you suspect you have a counterfeit note:

- **Do Not Use It Again:** It is illegal to knowingly use counterfeit money.
- **Take It to a Bank for Verification:** Bring the suspicious note to any bank. The staff can perform a professional
  appraisal to confirm its authenticity.
- **Keep Evidence and Report It:** If possible, record where and when you received the fake bill, and report it to the
  local police or [Public Security Bureau (PSB)](https://www.mps.gov.cn/).
- **Alert Other Travelers:** Share your experience on verified travel platforms or with fellow travelers.

## **Conclusion**

Handling cash safely in China doesn't have to be complicated. By combining the convenience of mobile payments with a
small supply of vetted, low-denomination banknotes and using the simple "six-step check," you can significantly reduce
the risk of encountering counterfeit currency and enjoy your trip with greater peace of mind.

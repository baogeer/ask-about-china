Traveling to China means stepping into a unique and highly advanced digital ecosystem. The Western apps you use daily
for messaging, navigation, and payments won't work. Instead, life is powered by a handful of "super apps" that make
travel incredibly convenient—once you know which ones to download and how to set them up.

This guide provides a curated list of the 10 essential apps every traveler needs for a smooth and hassle-free trip in
2025. From paying for street food to navigating sprawling subway systems, these tools will be your lifeline.

Before you start downloading, remember the "Great Firewall" blocks services like Google, Facebook, and WhatsApp. You
will need reliable internet access via a local SIM card or an eSIM, which we cover in our guides to [**internet access
in China**](/internet-access-in-china) and [**choosing a SIM card**](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china). All the apps
listed here are available on international app stores (like Apple's App Store and Google Play).

### Bonus: Essential Mini-Programs

them within the app:

### Safety & Privacy Tips

- **Permissions:** Be mindful of the permissions you grant. An app shouldn't need access to your contacts if it's just
  for navigation.

- **QR Code Hygiene:** When paying, always double-check the merchant's name and the amount on your screen before
  confirming.
- **Scam Avoidance:** Avoid scanning random QR codes on the street. Stick to official merchant codes. For more on this,
  see our [**China travel tips**](/china-travel-tips).

### One-Day Offline Survival

If your phone dies or you lose data, don't panic.

- **Offline Features:** Your translation app (with offline packs) and navigation app (with offline maps) will still
  work.
- **Cash & Cards:** This is why carrying backup cash is crucial. Major hotels and high-end restaurants will still accept
  international credit cards.
- **Hotel Help:** The front desk at your hotel can be a great resource. They can help you write down your destination in
  Chinese and call a taxi for you.
- **Pre-Trip Prep:** Our [**Beijing Airport Arrival Guide**](/beijing-airport-arrival-guide) and guide on [**How to Book
  a Hotel in China**](/) both emphasize the importance of having backup cash and your hotel address printed out.

No, all the essential apps listed are available in international app stores like the Apple App Store and Google Play.

**2. Can I use these apps on a dual-SIM phone?**\
Yes, a dual-SIM setup is ideal. You can use a Chinese data SIM for connectivity while keeping your home number active
for verification texts.

Many traveler-focused apps like Didi and Trip.com have clear language settings. For others, the English interface may be
partial or automatic based on your phone's system language.

**4. Is a local SIM card better than an eSIM for using these apps?**\
Both work well. An eSIM can be set up before you travel for instant connectivity on arrival. A physical SIM may offer
more data for a lower price but requires purchase and installation after you land.

non-negotiable. It is not required to use the Chinese apps listed here.

Immediately find another device, log into your Alipay and WeChat accounts to freeze them, and contact your bank to block
the linked cards.

**7. How do refunds work on apps like Meituan or Trip.com?**\
Most apps have a straightforward, in-app refund process. Funds are returned to your original payment source (your
digital wallet or linked card), which can take several business days.

**8. Is it safe to use Didi late at night?**\
Yes, Didi is generally considered safe. Use the in-app safety features like sharing your trip status with a contact.

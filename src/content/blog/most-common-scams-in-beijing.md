Beijing is a magnificent city, rich in history and culture, offering travelers an unforgettable experience. The vast
majority of locals are friendly, welcoming, and honest. However, like any major international metropolis, it has its
share of schemes targeting visitors who are unfamiliar with the environment.

Understanding the patterns of these common scams is the best way to protect yourself. This guide will detail the 10 most
frequent scams in Beijing and provide clear, actionable strategies to help you navigate the city with confidence and
peace of mind.

## **1. The "Art Student" & Tea Ceremony Scam**

This is one of Beijing’s most notorious scams, often found near popular tourist sites like Tiananmen Square, Wangfujing,
or the Houhai lake area.

- **The Pattern:** One or two well-dressed young people (claiming to be "art students" or just "students") will approach
  you enthusiastically, eager to practice their English. After building a quick rapport, they will invite you to a "
  great" nearby teahouse for a traditional tea ceremony or to see their "art exhibition."
- **Red Flags:** Overly friendly strangers with unnaturally fluent English in a tourist-heavy area; invitations to a
  specific, unknown location; refusing your suggestions for a different café or restaurant.
- **What to do instead:** Politely decline any invitation from a stranger to a private location. If you genuinely want
  to experience tea culture, choose a reputable chain teahouse or a place recommended by your hotel. Insist on going to
  a public place of your own choosing.

## **2. Unofficial 'Black' Taxis & Meter Scams**

While Beijing's official taxi system is generally reliable, unofficial "black" taxis operate outside airports, train
stations, and major attractions.

- **The Pattern:** Drivers solicit passengers outside the official taxi queues, often quoting a high, fixed price
  instead of using the meter. Alternatively, they might use a rigged meter that jumps fares at an alarming rate.
- **Red Flags:** The driver refuses to use the meter ("dǎ biǎo"); the quoted price is significantly higher than normal;
  the vehicle lacks official taxi company logos and a roof light.
- **What to do instead:** Always wait in the designated official taxi queue. Before getting in, insist the driver use
  the meter. If the driver refuses, find another taxi. You can also use ride-hailing apps, which offer transparent
  pricing and a trip record. For public transport options, check the [Beijing Subway](https://www.bjsubway.com/en/)
  website.

## **3. Fake Monks & Temple Donations**

In tourist areas, you may encounter people in monastic robes asking for donations.

- **The Pattern:** The "monk" will hand you a talisman or a prayer bead and then ask you to "donate" to their temple or
  a charity, often demanding a large sum. They can become very persistent.
- **Red Flags:** Genuine monks rarely solicit money on the streets. They are typically serene and will not pressure you
  into giving.
- **What to do instead:** Smile, wave your hand, and walk away. Do not accept anything they try to hand you; once you
  take it, it becomes much harder to disengage. If you wish to donate to a temple, do so directly inside an official
  temple at the designated merit box.

## **4. The "Hello!" Greeting & Bar Tab Scam**

This is similar to the tea ceremony scam, but the setting is a bar.

- **The Pattern:** An attractive young woman or man strikes up a conversation and invites you for a drink at a nearby
  bar they "know."
- **Red Flags:** Often occurs in nightlife districts like Sanlitun or Houhai; the person is overly effusive; the bar is
  empty or in an isolated location.
- **What to do instead:** Never follow a stranger to a bar they suggest. If you want to go out, choose busy,
  well-reviewed establishments recommended on guide apps or by other travelers.

## **5. Rickshaw Overcharging**

Taking a rickshaw (a three-wheeled pedicab) through the old alleyways (hutongs) can be a fun experience, but it can also
be a trap.

- **The Pattern:** The driver quotes a very low price, such as ¥10. At the end of the ride, they will claim the price
  was ¥10 "per minute" or "per person," demanding a final fare of several hundred yuan.
- **Red Flags:** An unbelievably low initial price; the driver is vague about the pricing structure before you start.
- **What to do instead:** Before getting on, use a phone calculator to confirm the **total price** with the driver,
  making it clear this is the final price for everyone. The best approach is to book hutong tours through your hotel or
  a reputable tour operator.

## **6. The "Free" Tour Guide & Shopping Traps**

At major attractions like the Forbidden City or the Great Wall, someone may offer to be your "free" guide.

- **The Pattern:** They will show you around and eventually lead you to a specific jade shop, silk store, or herbal
  medicine clinic, where they conspire with the shopkeeper to pressure you into making overpriced purchases.
- **Red Flags:** The unsolicited offer of a "free" service.
- **What to do instead:** Rent an official audio guide from the attraction or hire a licensed guide. Be wary of any
  offer that sounds too good to be true.

## **7. Fake Tickets & Scalpers**

Outside popular sites like the Forbidden City or the National Museum, scalpers may try to sell you "discounted" or "
last-minute" tickets.

- **The Pattern:** The tickets they sell are either fake or are invalid tickets booked using someone else's ID.
- **Red Flags:** Anyone selling tickets outside of the official ticket office.
- **What to do instead:** Always buy tickets from the official website or the official ticket window on-site. Many
  attractions now require advance online booking with your passport information, so plan ahead. For help with your
  travel preparations, see our [Guide to Applying for a Chinese Visa](/apply-for-chinese-visa/).

## **8. The Dropped Wallet or Fake Emergency Ploy**

This is a distraction scam, usually performed by a team.

- **The Pattern:** Someone "accidentally" drops a wallet in front of you. As you benevolently point it out or help pick
  it up, their accomplice steals your belongings. A variation involves someone feigning an emergency (e.g., claiming a
  family member is in the hospital) to ask you for money.
- **Red Flags:** A strange or sudden incident in a crowded place like the subway or a market.
- **What to do instead:** Stay vigilant, especially in crowds. Keep your belongings secure and wear your backpack on
  your chest. Do not readily believe strangers' sob stories. For legal matters while traveling, consult
  our [Legal Guide to Traveling in China](/legal-guide-to-traveling-in-china).

## **9. The Counterfeit Money Swap**

This scam sometimes occurs in taxis or with small street vendors.

- **The Pattern:** You pay with a genuine ¥100 note. The recipient quickly swaps it for a fake one and claims you gave
  them a counterfeit, demanding another payment.
- **Red Flags:** The person makes an unnatural movement after taking your money; the transaction happens in a dimly lit
  environment.
- **What to do instead:** Use mobile payment methods like WeChat Pay or Alipay whenever possible. If you must use cash,
  try to pay with smaller denominations. For more detailed verification tips, read our guide
  on [How Foreign Tourists Can Spot Fake RMB](/spot-fake-rmb). Withdrawing cash from an ATM at
  a reputable bank ensures you get genuine notes.
- **Response:** Verify your banknote before handing it over, try to pay with smaller denominations, and pay attention to
  the driver’s hands during the transaction.

## **10. Silk Market & Electronics Scams**

At places like the Silk Market (Xiushui Jie), bargaining is part of the culture, but scams exist.

- **The Pattern:** The vendor shows you a high-quality sample, but after you pay, they package a defective or inferior
  item for you. They may also sell counterfeit brand-name goods and refurbished electronics.
- **Red Flags:** The price is far below market value; the vendor rushes you to pay.
- **What to do instead:** Insist on "what you see is what you get." Before paying, carefully inspect the exact item you
  are buying, not the sample. For branded goods, understand that the prices here make it highly unlikely they are
  authentic. Bargain hard—you can often start your offer at 10-30% of the initial asking price.

# **What to Do If You Were Scammed**

If the worst happens, stay calm and take these steps:

1. **Avoid Direct Confrontation:** Your safety is the top priority, especially if you are outnumbered.
2. **Leave the Scene:** Get to a safe, public area as soon as possible.
3. **Gather Evidence:** Note the scammer's appearance, the location, time, license plate number, and any other details.
   Keep receipts or the fake merchandise as evidence.
4. **Report to the Police:** **Dial 110**, which is the police emergency number in China. You can also go to the nearest
   police station. While recovering your money may be unlikely, reporting the crime helps police track and stop these
   activities. You can contact your country's embassy or consulate for assistance; major embassies publish traveler
   alerts and contact information on their websites.

5. **Freeze Your Cards:** If your bank card information was compromised, contact your bank immediately to report it lost
   or stolen.

To ensure you stay connected during your trip, it’s vital to understand how to get a SIM card and internet access. Check

# **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**1. Is the tea ceremony scam really that common?**\
It was once very common, especially in tourist hotspots. While it has decreased in recent years, it still happens. The
key is to refuse any invitation from a stranger to a private location.

**2. How can I avoid being overcharged by rickshaw drivers?**\
The best method is to use a calculator to agree on a final total price before the ride starts, not a per-person or
per-minute rate. Alternatively, avoid hailing rickshaws that are actively soliciting on the street.

**3. Are all street charity donations fake?**\
The vast majority of people actively soliciting donations in tourist areas (whether claiming to be monks or fundraising
for the disabled) are likely scams. Donate directly to reputable organizations instead.

**4. Can I buy genuine brand-name products at the markets?**\
It is nearly impossible to buy authentic luxury goods at a low price in places like the Silk Market. Treat them as fun
souvenirs and pay a price that reflects that.

**5. Do I still need cash in Beijing?**\
While mobile payments (Alipay/WeChat Pay) are ubiquitous, carrying a small amount of cash is still useful for some small
vendors, certain taxis, or in case of app failures. It’s best to have small-denomination notes on hand.

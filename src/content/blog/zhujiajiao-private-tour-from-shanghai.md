A good private tour will customize the route based on your interests, but here are the essential sights and activities
you shouldn't miss in Zhujiajiao.

### Must-See Attractions

  landmark. Standing on the bridge, you can get a great view of the bustling Caogang River.
- **North Street (北大街):** This Ming and Qing dynasty-style old street is the most lively part of the town, lined with
  specialty shops, restaurants, and century-old establishments.
- **Kezhi Garden (课植园):** A manor-style garden that blends Chinese and Western architecture, it offers an exquisite
  layout and a tranquil environment—a perfect spot to escape the crowds and appreciate garden artistry.
- **Gondola Ride on Caogang River:** Taking a hand-rowed boat through the water alleys is the best way to experience the
  water town's atmosphere. Listen to the boatman's local dialect as the scenery drifts by for a truly relaxing
  experience.

### Unique Activities to Experience

- **Taste Local Snacks:** Braised pork wrapped in leaves (*zāròu*), Grandma's sticky rice dumplings (*āpó zòng*),
  roasted green soybeans (*zhì máodòu*), and various pastries are local specialties you must try.

  your time to explore.

## Transportation from Shanghai to Zhujiajiao

A private tour usually includes a dedicated car service, which is the most convenient and comfortable option. However,
it's useful to know about other transportation methods.

- **Private Car (Recommended):** This is one of the key advantages of a private tour. The driver will pick you up
  directly from your hotel for the approximately 1-hour journey, saving you the trouble of navigating public transport.
- **Metro:** Take Shanghai Metro Line 17 directly to the "Zhujiajiao" station. From the exit, it's about a 15-20 minute
  walk to the ancient town area. This is the most budget-friendly option.
- **Bus:** At the Puan Road/Yan'an East Road bus station in downtown Shanghai, you can take the "Huzhu Express Line"
  directly to the Zhujiajiao bus station.

Choosing the right transport is a key part of your travel planning. For more information, you can refer to our [**guide

   and personal assistant. They can help you avoid crowds, find the most authentic food, and handle all the small
   details.

   stories about local history, architecture, and lifestyle that you wouldn't get on a large, rushed tour.

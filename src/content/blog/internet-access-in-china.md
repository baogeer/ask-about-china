## The Basics of Connectivity in China

Before diving into specifics, let's cover the primary ways you can get online. Most visitors rely on a combination of
these methods for consistent internet access.

- **Local SIM/eSIM:** Purchasing a Chinese SIM card is often the most reliable and cost-effective way to get mobile
  data.

- **Pocket Wi-Fi:** These portable hotspots can be rented before your trip or upon arrival, providing data for multiple
  devices.
- **Public & Hotel Wi-Fi:** Wi-Fi is widely available in hotels, cafes, airports, and shopping malls. However, many
  networks require a Chinese mobile number for verification.

## Understanding the Great Firewall

China's internet is managed through a sophisticated system often called the **“Great Firewall.”** This system regulates
online content and blocks access to many non-Chinese websites and applications.

Blocked services include:

- **Google Services:** Search, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Drive
- **Social Media:** Facebook, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), WhatsApp, Telegram
- **News & Media:** The New York Times, BBC, YouTube

It is important for visitors to respect local laws. Accessing blocked content is a legally sensitive area. This guide
does not provide legal advice, and you are responsible for your own actions.

## Getting a Local SIM Card with a Chinese Number

For most travelers, a local SIM card is the best option for reliable data and access to services that require a Chinese
number.

### Step-by-Step Guide:

1. **Choose a Location:** You can buy SIM cards at major international airports (like Beijing Capital or Shanghai
   Pudong) or at official retail stores.  
   → See our [Beijing Airport Arrival Guide](/beijing-airport-arrival-guide).
2. **Select a Carrier:**
    - [China Mobile](https://www.chinamobileltd.com/en/) – best rural coverage
    - [China Unicom](https://www.chinaunicomglobal.com/) – strong in cities
    - [China Telecom](https://www.chinatelecomglobal.com/) – great international options
3. **Real-Name Registration:** Bring your passport for verification.
4. **Choose a Plan & Top-Up:** Prepaid data plans are flexible; staff will assist in setup.
5. **APN Settings:** Usually automatic; ask staff for help if needed.

## Alternatives If You Can't Get a Chinese Number

- **International Roaming:** May bypass the Great Firewall but is costly.
- **Travel eSIMs:** Providers like [Airalo](https://www.airalo.com/), [Holafly](https://holafly.com/),
  or [Nomad](https://www.getnomad.app/) offer China-compatible plans.
- **Wi-Fi Only:** Usable for short trips, but some apps require phone verification.

> Note: Without a Chinese number, using WeChat Pay or Alipay may be limited. See our

## Using Services Requiring Phone Authentication

Many apps verify identity via SMS. Having a local number simplifies access.

- Avoid using **virtual number services**, which are unreliable and may violate terms.
- If your app relies on SMS login, prepare alternative verification (e.g., email).

## Practical Tips for a Smooth Digital Experience

- **Download Apps Before You Arrive:** WeChat, Alipay, Didi, Baidu Maps, Translator.
- **Enable International SMS:** Critical for receiving bank codes abroad.
- **Set Up Alternative 2FA:** Use apps like [Authy](https://authy.com/) for offline codes.
- **Use Public Wi-Fi Safely:** Avoid sensitive logins; consider trusted VPNs (where legal).

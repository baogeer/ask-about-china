For first-time visitors to China, one of the most pressing concerns is often how to use public restrooms. From locating
a facility to encountering different types of toilets, a little anxiety can easily spoil a good travel mood. Rest
assured, this guide is the "ultimate survival manual" you need. We will break down the entire process of finding and
using toilets in China, providing everything from a list of essential items to useful phrases. Overall, public toilet
facilities in China's major cities are rapidly improving, and with a little preparation, the experience will be much
smoother than you might imagine. Just remember this: **always carry your own tissues and hand sanitizer**, and you've
mastered 90% of the secret.

## Types of Public Toilets and Their Facilities

Public toilets in China (公厕, gōngcè) vary widely, and facility standards differ by location. Understanding these
differences will help you manage your expectations.

- **High-End Venues (Large Malls, Airports, High-Speed Rail Stations):**

    - **Facilities:** Usually very clean, offering free toilet paper, hand soap, and hand dryers. Both Western-style
      sitting toilets (马桶, mǎtǒng) and squat toilets (蹲厕, dūncè) are available, with clear icons to indicate which
      is which.
    - **Features:** These are the closest to international standards and are your best bet for a comfortable experience
      and to "restock" supplies. For a detailed airport guide, check out our [**Beijing Airport Arrival Guide
      **](/beijing-airport-arrival-guide/).

- **Mid-Range Venues (Subway Stations, Casual Restaurants, Fast-Food Chains):**

    - **Facilities:** Generally clean and usable. They may not provide free toilet paper or hand soap. Squat toilets are
      more common than sitting toilets.
    - **Features:** Subway station restrooms are crucial lifelines as you navigate the city. To learn more about urban
      transit, read our [**guide to transportation in China**](/transportation-in-china).

- **Basic Venues (Parks, Tourist Attractions, Highway Rest Areas):**

    - **Facilities:** Cleanliness can vary greatly. Almost all will be squat toilets, and they rarely provide toilet
      paper. Some toilets in scenic areas or parks may require a small fee (usually 1 RMB).
    - **Features:** Be prepared for the basics. In these places, your personal "hygiene survival kit" will be
      invaluable.

## How to Find a Toilet Quickly

Finding a toilet in China isn't difficult once you know how to recognize the signs and use the right tools.

1. **Recognize the Signs:**

    - **Text:** Look for the characters “公共厕所,” “洗手间” (xǐshǒujiān), or “卫生间” (wèishēngjiān).
    - **Icons:** The universal male/female pictograms are very common.
    - **Directional Arrows:** In malls, subway stations, and scenic spots, follow signs with "↑ WC" or "↑ 洗手间."

2. **Use a Map App:**
    - Amap (高德地图) and Baidu Maps (百度地图) are the best map applications in China. Simply type "toilet" or "公厕"
      into the search bar, and the app will display all nearby public restrooms. Some listings even indicate if they
      have paper or are free. These apps are vital for life in China; for more recommendations, see our guide to the [*
      *most useful apps for living in China**](/most-useful-apps-for-living-in-china).

3. **Ask a Local:**
    - If you can't find one, politely ask a nearby shopkeeper or pedestrian for help. Use our [**Chinese travel phrases
      guide**](/chinese-travel-phrases) and point to the sentence for "Excuse me, where is the restroom?" (Qǐngwèn,
      xǐshǒujiān zài nǎlǐ?). People are usually happy to point you in the right direction.

## Step-by-Step Guide: From Entry to Exit

Master these steps, and you can handle even a squat toilet with confidence on your first try.

- **Step 1: Prepare Your "Survival Kit"**
    - Before entering a stall, make sure you have enough toilet paper or wet wipes and a small bottle of hand sanitizer.
      This is one of the most critical steps in your pre-trip packing, so don’t forget to check our [**China packing
      guide**](/china-packing-guide/).
- **Step 2: Queue and Enter**
    - Queuing is basic social etiquette in China. Please wait in an orderly line outside the door. For more on local
      customs, our [**China etiquette guide**](/china-etiquette-guide/) can offer more insights.
- **Step 3: Using a Squat Toilet Correctly**
    - Face the hooded end of the toilet. Place your feet on the grooved, anti-slip pads on either side, then squat down.
      Keep your center of gravity stable. Beginners can lightly touch the wall or door for balance.
- **Step 4: Disposing of Toilet Paper**
    - **The Golden Rule:** Unless there is a clear sign indicating otherwise, **do not throw toilet paper into the
      toilet bowl**, as it can cause blockages. Please dispose of used toilet paper in the wastebasket provided in the
      stall.
- **Step 5: Flushing**
    - The flushing mechanism is usually a button on the wall behind the toilet, a handle on the side wall, or a foot
      pedal. Look around, and you will find it.
- **Step 6: Washing and Drying Your Hands**
    - Turn on the tap to wash your hands. If there is no hand soap or dryer, the hand sanitizer and tissues from your "
      survival kit" will come in handy.

## Health and Safety Tips

Maintaining personal hygiene and security is fundamental to a pleasant journey.

- **Personal Hygiene:** Always carry a pack of tissues, a pack of wet wipes, and a small bottle of alcohol-based hand
  sanitizer. This is a point we emphasize in all of our [**China travel tips**](/china-travel-tips/).
- **Property Safety:** In crowded public restrooms, wear your backpack on your front and keep an eye on your phone and
  wallet. Be particularly wary of pickpockets in tourist-heavy areas. For more information, read our [**China travel
  safety tips**](/china-travel-safety-tips/).
- **Avoid Peak Times:** At popular attractions, the hours after lunch and before closing are peak times for restroom
  use. Try to go during off-peak hours.

## Accessibility and Family-Friendly Facilities

Accessibility in China is constantly improving, especially in new buildings.

- **Accessible Restrooms (残疾人洗手间):** Airports, large shopping malls, and new subway stations usually have spacious
  accessible restrooms equipped with sitting toilets and enough room for a wheelchair.
- **Nursery Rooms (母婴室):** Similarly, well-equipped nursery rooms are becoming increasingly common in high-end
  venues, providing great convenience for families with babies. You can look for this amenity when booking
  family-friendly accommodations. For tips on booking, see our [**China hotel booking guide
  **](/china-hotel-booking-guide/).
- **Advice for Seniors and Children:** If traveling with elderly people or children, prioritize restrooms in large malls
  or upscale hotels. The sitting toilets and cleaner environment will be more comfortable for them.

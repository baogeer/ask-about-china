## The China Customs Process: Red vs. Green Channels

Upon arriving in China, you will proceed through a customs checkpoint. You’ll see two options: the Green Channel and the
Red Channel.

- **Green Channel:** For travelers who have nothing to declare. This means you are carrying items within duty-free
  limits and have no restricted or prohibited goods.
- **Red Channel:** For travelers who need to declare items. You must use this channel if you are carrying goods that
  exceed duty-free allowances, are restricted, or require special permits.

The golden rule is honesty. You must complete a Customs Declaration Form truthfully. Failure to declare items can result
in fines, confiscation, or more serious legal trouble. When in doubt, always choose the Red Channel.

## Duty-Free Allowances for Personal Use

For more details on customs channels, duty-free allowances, and prohibited items, see our
comprehensive [What You Can and Cannot Bring into China](/china-customs-guide) guide.\
As a tourist, you can bring a reasonable amount of personal effects into China without paying duty. "Personal effects"
are items intended for your own use during your trip, not for resale.

### Tobacco & Alcohol

While limits can change, typical duty-free allowances for passengers aged 18 and over are:

- **Tobacco:** Commonly up to 400 cigarettes, or an equivalent amount of cigars or other tobacco products.
- **Alcohol:** Typically one or two bottles of liquor (up to 1.5 liters total, with alcohol content above 12%).

**Important:** These are common examples, not fixed laws. Always verify the latest duty-free caps with the General
Administration of Customs of China before you travel.

### Perfume, Cosmetics, and Personal Food

A reasonable quantity of cosmetics, perfume, and food for your personal consumption during the trip is generally allowed
without declaration.

## Cash and Monetary Instruments

There are limits on how much currency you can bring into or take out of China.

- **Foreign Currency:** You must declare any foreign currency exceeding the equivalent of USD $5,000.
- **Chinese Yuan (RMB):** There is also a limit on the amount of local currency you can carry, typically around 20,000
  RMB.

These thresholds are subject to change, so confirm the current amounts before your trip. Using bank cards and credit
cards is perfectly fine and does not require declaration.

## Items You Must Declare

Declaring an item doesn’t automatically mean you’ll pay tax on it. It’s simply a required legal step. You should always
use the Red Channel if you are carrying:

- **High-Value Electronics:** Items like expensive cameras, laptops, or audio equipment that you intend to take back out
  of China.
- **Professional Equipment:** Professional-grade cameras, video recorders, film equipment, or survey tools often require
  declaration.
- **Drones and Satellite Phones:** These are considered special communication devices and may require pre-approval in
  addition to declaration.
- **Commercial Samples:** Anything intended for business or trade purposes.
- **Large Quantities of an Item:** Carrying many units of the same product may raise suspicion that they are for resale.
- **Food of Animal Origin:** This includes certain dairy products, cured meats, and seafood.
- **Plants and Seeds:** Most live plants, seeds, and soil are heavily restricted.
- **Prescription Medicine:** Especially controlled substances or large quantities. Carry them in their original
  packaging with a doctor’s note.

## Prohibited and Restricted Items

For the most current list of prohibited and restricted items, please refer to
the [General Administration of Customs of China official website](http://english.customs.gov.cn) before traveling.These
items are strictly controlled and should not be brought into China. Attempting to import them can lead to severe
consequences.

### Prohibited Items (Do Not Bring)

- **Illegal Drugs:** China has a zero-tolerance policy. Possession or trafficking of narcotics can lead to extreme
  penalties, including life imprisonment or the death penalty.
- **Firearms, Ammunition, and Explosives:** This includes replica weapons and toy guns that look realistic.
- **Certain Knives:** Switchblades or other knives deemed to be weapons are forbidden.
- **Endangered Species Products:** Any items made from ivory, rhinoceros horn, tiger bone, or other endangered animal
  and plant species are illegal.
- **Politically Sensitive Materials:** Printed materials, films, or digital media that are deemed harmful to China's
  politics, economy, culture, or ethics.
- **Pornographic Materials:** Any form of pornography is illegal.
- **Certain Live Animals:** Bringing pets requires specific permits and quarantine procedures. Other live animals are
  generally prohibited.
- **Soil.**

### Restricted Items (Check Rules Carefully)

- **Fresh Produce:** Fresh fruits and vegetables are generally not allowed to prevent the introduction of pests.
- **Meat and Dairy:** Unprocessed meat, raw milk, and certain cheeses may be restricted, especially from regions with
  known animal diseases.
- **Cultural Relics:** Exporting protected cultural relics is illegal without a government permit. If you buy antiques,
  get them officially appraised and cleared for export.
- **Radio Transmitters/Receivers:** Equipment that can send or receive radio signals may need a license.

Always check the latest official lists from Chinese customs authorities, as regulations can be updated based on global
health and security situations.

## Special Categories: Medicine, Drones, and Antiques

For more details on ensuring you’re medically covered while traveling, see our [**Travel Health Insurance for China
**](/travel-health-insurance-china) guide.### Medicine Policy

- **Over-the-Counter (OTC):** A small, reasonable amount for personal use is usually fine.
- **Prescription Drugs:** Carry them in their original containers with a clear label. Bring a copy of the prescription
  and a doctor's note, preferably translated into Mandarin.
- **Narcotics/Psychotropics:** Medications containing substances like pseudoephedrine, psychotropics, or narcotics are
  highly controlled. You must have an official permit, or they risk confiscation.

### Drones and Radio Equipment

Importing and using drones in China is complex. Some cities have strict no-fly zones. You may need to register your
device upon arrival or even get pre-approval. For casual tourism, it is often easier to leave the drone at home.

### Exporting Cultural Relics and Antiques

If you purchase art, calligraphy, or antiques in China, be cautious. Items deemed to be "cultural relics" cannot leave
the country without an official red wax seal from the Cultural Relics Administration. Reputable dealers can assist with
this process.

## Traveling with Children

Families can bring reasonable supplies for their children.

- **Baby Formula and Food:** A quantity sufficient for your trip is generally permitted.
- **Medication:** The same rules for adult medicine apply. Keep it in original packaging with a doctor's note.
- **Strollers and Car Seats:** These are considered personal effects and are not an issue.

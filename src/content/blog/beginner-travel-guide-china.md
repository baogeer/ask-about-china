## When to Go and Where to Start

Your experience in China can vary dramatically based on when and where you travel. Strategic planning is key to a great
trip.

### Best Seasons to Travel

- **Spring (April–May) & Autumn (September–October):** These are by far the best times to visit. You'll enjoy pleasant
  weather, clear skies, and moderate temperatures across most of the country.
- **Summer (June–August):** Can be very hot and rainy, especially in the south. It is also peak domestic travel season
  due to school holidays, meaning larger crowds and higher prices.
- **Winter (November–March):** Often cold and gray, particularly in the north. However, it's a great time for budget
  travel and for seeing sights like the Harbin Ice Festival.

**Crucially, avoid traveling during China's major national holidays**, especially the Spring Festival (Chinese New Year,
typically in Jan/Feb) and the National Day Golden Week (the first week of October). During these periods, hundreds of
millions of people are on the move, making travel extremely crowded and expensive.

### Choosing Your Destinations

- **Tier 1 Cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen):** These are the modern, international hubs. They are easy to
  navigate, have more English speakers, but are also the most expensive.
- **Tier 2 & 3 Cities (Xi'an, Chengdu, Guilin, Hangzhou):** These cities offer a fantastic blend of history, culture,
  and affordability. They provide a more "authentic" experience while still being accessible to foreign tourists.

### Sample First-Timer Itineraries

1. **The Classic Triangle (8–10 Days): Beijing → Xi'an → Shanghai.** This route covers the imperial capital, the ancient
   Terracotta Warriors, and the cosmopolitan financial hub. It’s the quintessential first trip, easily connected by
   high-speed rail.
2. **Eastern China Charm (7–9 Days): Shanghai → Suzhou → Hangzhou.** Known as "paradise on earth," this route explores
   classical gardens, ancient water towns, and the beautiful West Lake, all just a short train ride from Shanghai.
3. **Sichuan & Surrounds (7–10 Days): Chengdu → Leshan → Chongqing.** For food lovers and panda enthusiasts. Base
   yourself in laid-back Chengdu, take a day trip to the Leshan Giant Buddha, and end in the futuristic "mountain city"
   of Chongqing.

## Visas & Entry Basics

Every international traveler needs a valid passport and, in most cases, a visa to enter China.

- **Passport Validity:** Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your planned entry date.
- **Visa Types:** Most tourists will need a Tourist (L) visa. Other common types include Business (M) and Student (X)
  visas. Ensure you apply for the one that matches your trip's purpose.
- **Entry Process:** Upon arrival, you will fill out an arrival card and go through immigration. Officers will check
  your passport and visa, and may ask about your itinerary. Keep a printed copy of your flight and hotel bookings handy.
- **Keep Copies:** Always have digital and physical copies of your passport's main page and your Chinese visa.

For a step-by-step walkthrough, our [**China Visa Application Guide**](/apply-for-chinese-visa) provides all the details
you need.

## Money & Payments: The Digital Revolution

China operates largely as a cashless society, which can be a hurdle for first-timers.

- **Cash (CNY/RMB):** It's essential to have some cash on hand for taxis, small vendors, or as a backup. Around
  1,000-2,000 CNY is a good amount to start with.
- **Credit Cards:** International credit cards (Visa, Mastercard) are only accepted at major hotels, high-end
  restaurants, and large international stores. Do not rely on them for daily expenses.
- **Mobile Payments (The Main Way):** Alipay and WeChat Pay are king. Virtually everything is paid for by scanning a QR
  code. As a tourist, you can now link your international credit card to both apps. Setting this up is a top priority
  for a smooth trip.

To get started, you'll need reliable internet. See our guides on [**internet access in China
**](/internet-access-in-china) and how to set up an [**expat SIM card**](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china).

## Transport Fundamentals

China's public transport is modern, efficient, and a joy to use.

- **High-Speed Rail:** The best way to travel between cities. It's fast, clean, and affordable.
- **Metro Systems:** The easiest way to navigate major cities. Signs and announcements are bilingual (Mandarin/English).
- **Ride-Hailing vs. Taxis:** Use ride-hailing apps like Didi. They are often cheaper, more transparent, and eliminate
  language barriers for destinations.

For a deep dive into booking tickets and navigating the system, read our complete guides on [**transportation in China
**](/transportation-in-china) and our [**China travel tips**](/china-travel-tips) for budget-specific advice.

## Accommodation for Beginners

Finding the right place to stay is crucial for a comfortable trip.

- **Neighborhoods:** Choose hotels near a central subway line. This makes exploring the city incredibly easy and saves
  you time and money on taxis.
- **Foreigner-Licensed Hotels:** CRITICAL: Not all hotels in China are licensed to host foreigners. You must confirm
  this before booking. Platforms like Booking.com and Trip.com often let you filter for this. Reputable international
  chains and most youth hostels are safe bets.
- **Deposits:** Most hotels require a cash security deposit (usually a few hundred CNY) upon check-in, which is refunded
  when you leave.
- **Chinese Address:** Save your hotel's address in Chinese characters on your phone. This is invaluable for showing
  taxi drivers.

Our guide on [**How to Book a Hotel in China**](/) covers these points in greater detail.

## Connectivity & Language

Staying connected and overcoming the language barrier are key concerns for beginners.

- **Getting Online:** The "Great Firewall" blocks many Western apps and websites (Google, Facebook, Instagram, etc.). To
  stay connected and access these services, you'll need a reliable VPN or an eSIM with built-in firewall-circumventing
  features.

- **Essential Apps:** Download these before you go:

    - **WeChat & Alipay:** For payments and communication.
    - **A Map App:** Like Baidu Maps or Amap (with English interfaces available).
    - **Didi:** For ride-hailing.
    - **A Translation App:** Like Google Translate (offline package downloaded) or Pleco.

- **Language:** Major airports, high-speed train stations, and subways have English signage. In tourist areas, you'll
  find some English. Elsewhere, it's rare. Learning a few key phrases like "Nǐ hǎo" (Hello), "Xièxiè" (Thank you), and "
  Duōshǎo qián?" (How much is it?) goes a long way.

## Etiquette & Safety

China is generally a very safe country for travelers, but knowing local customs and being aware of your surroundings is
important.

- **Basic Etiquette:** Let people off the train/metro before you board. Be prepared for crowds and less personal space
  than you may be used to. Tipping is not customary.
- **Common Scams:** Be wary of the "tea ceremony" scam or students who are "practicing English" and invite you
  somewhere. Politely decline any unsolicited offers. Read our guide on the [**most common scams in Beijing
  **](/most-common-scams-in-beijing) for more examples.
- **Personal Safety:** Violent crime is rare. Petty theft can occur in crowded places, so keep your valuables secure.
- **Police Registration (PSB):** Your hotel will automatically register your stay with the local Public Security
  Bureau (PSB). This is a mandatory and routine procedure.

## Food & Water Basics

Exploring Chinese cuisine is a highlight of any trip.

- **What to Eat:** Be adventurous! Each region has its specialty. Don't just stick to fried rice. Use picture menus or
  translation apps to order.
- **Where to Eat:** From street food stalls to high-end restaurants, there are options for every budget. Busy,
  local-filled eateries are usually a sign of good food.
- **Dietary Needs:** If you have allergies or dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian), have these written down clearly
  in Chinese to show restaurant staff.
- **Water:** Do not drink tap water. Stick to bottled water, which is cheap and widely available. Water from kettles in
  hotel rooms is safe to drink after boiling.

---

## Health & Practicalities

- **Pharmacies:** Pharmacies are common, but staff rarely speak English. Have a translation app ready if you need
  something specific. For prescription medicine, bring it with you in its original packaging, along with a doctor's
  note.
- **Travel Insurance:** Comprehensive travel insurance that covers medical emergencies is non-negotiable.
- **Restrooms:** Public toilets can be a mixed bag. Carry your own tissues and hand sanitizer, as these are rarely
  provided. Most public toilets are squat-style, though Western-style toilets are common in hotels and malls.
- **Power Plugs:** China uses 220V voltage. Sockets are typically a combination type that accepts both two-pin
  American/Japanese plugs and three-pin Australian plugs. A universal adapter is always a good idea.

---

## Packing for China

Pack smart to stay comfortable and mobile.

- **Layers:** Clothing that can be layered is perfect for China's variable climates.
- **Comfortable Shoes:** You will walk a lot. This is non-negotiable.
- **Daypack:** Essential for carrying water, a power bank, tissues, and other daily necessities.
- **Tech:** A high-capacity power bank is a lifesaver. Don't forget your universal travel adapter.
- **Health Kit:** Tissues, hand sanitizer, and any personal medications.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Can I get a visa on arrival in China?**\
Generally, no. For most nationalities and entry points, you must obtain a visa in advance from a Chinese embassy or
consulate in your home country.

**Is tipping expected in China?**\
No, tipping is not a part of the culture and is not expected in restaurants, taxis, or hotels. The only exception might
be for high-end tour guides or drivers on private tours.

**What are the public toilets like?**\
They vary. In malls, airports, and hotels, they are modern and clean. In public parks, subway stations, or rural areas,
expect squat toilets and bring your own toilet paper.

**Is tap water safe to drink?**\
No, do not drink tap water anywhere in China. Drink bottled water or water that has been boiled.

**What's the best way to access blocked websites like Google and Facebook?**\
A reputable VPN service is the most common method. Alternatively, purchasing a travel eSIM that offers roaming data can
sometimes bypass the firewall automatically.

**Is it okay to bargain in markets?**\
Yes, in tourist markets and with street vendors, bargaining is expected. A good rule of thumb is to start by offering
about half the initial asking price and meeting somewhere in the middle. In department stores and restaurants, prices
are fixed.

**Where should I get a Chinese SIM card?**\
The easiest option is an eSIM purchased before you leave. If you need a physical SIM, you can get one at the airport,
but it's cheaper to go to an official carrier store (like China Unicom or China Mobile) in the city. You will need your
passport.

**Is China safe to walk around at night?**\
Yes, China's major cities are very safe, even late at night. Standard precautions apply, but you will generally see many
people out and about.

**Is it easy to travel with a stroller for my child?**\
Yes. Modern infrastructure like subways and high-speed rail stations have elevators and ramps, making them
stroller-friendly.

**What about luggage on trains?**\
It's manageable. You handle your own bags. There are overhead racks for smaller luggage and dedicated storage areas at
the end of each car for large suitcases.

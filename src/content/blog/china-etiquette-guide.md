## Core Values That Shape Chinese Society

To understand Chinese etiquette, it helps to be aware of the cultural values that underpin it.

- **Respect for Elders and Authority:** Age and hierarchy are highly respected. Always show deference to older
  individuals.
- **Harmony (和谐, héxié):** Group harmony is often prioritized over individual desires. Avoiding public confrontation
  and maintaining a pleasant atmosphere is crucial.
- **Saving Face (面子, miànzi):** "Face" represents a person's reputation, dignity, and social standing. Causing someone
  to lose face—by publicly criticizing, embarrassing, or contradicting them—is a major social faux pas. Likewise, giving
  someone face through compliments or respect is a way to build goodwill.
- **Modesty and Humility (谦虚, qiānxū):** Bragging or overt self-promotion is generally frowned upon. Responding to
  compliments with a polite deflection ("Oh, it was nothing") is common.
- **Queuing (排队, páiduì):** While in the past it was less common, queuing is now the expected norm in major cities,
  especially among younger generations. Respect lines at stations, shops, and attractions.

## Greetings, Names, and Personal Space

First impressions matter. A polite greeting sets a positive tone for any interaction.

### Greetings and Forms of Address

- A simple nod and a "你好" (nǐ hǎo - hello) is the standard greeting.
- Handshakes are common, especially in business settings. Wait for the other person to initiate and keep the handshake
  brief and not overly firm.
- Address people using their title and surname. For example, a person named Wang Wei who is a manager would be "Manager
  Wang" (王经理, Wáng jīnglǐ). Using just the surname is also common. First names are typically reserved for close
  friends and family.

### Personal Space

Personal space is generally smaller in China than in many Western cultures, especially in crowded public areas. Don't be
surprised if people stand closer to you in lines or on public transport.

---

## Behavior in Public Spaces

Chinese cities are bustling and full of energy. Blending in requires being mindful of your surroundings.

- **Voice Volume:** Speak in a moderate tone. Loud conversations or shouting in public, especially on trains or in
  restaurants, are considered disruptive.
- **Civic Conduct:** Spitting and jaywalking are illegal and can result in on-the-spot fines. Use designated trash bins
  for litter.
- **Escalator Etiquette:** The general rule is to stand on the right and let others walk on the left.
- **Public Transit:** It is customary and expected to give up your seat to the elderly, pregnant women, people with
  disabilities, or adults with small children.

## Dining and Banquet Etiquette

Sharing a meal is a cornerstone of Chinese social life. Understanding the rules of the table is essential.

### Seating and Ordering

- The seat of honor is usually the one facing the entrance or the host’s seat. As a guest, wait to be shown where to
  sit.
- Meals are almost always served family-style, with shared dishes placed in the center of the table. It is polite to
  sample a variety of dishes. Order a balanced meal including vegetables, meat, and a staple like rice or noodles.

### Chopstick Rules: The Do's and Don'ts

- **Do** use the serving chopsticks (公筷, gōngkuài) if provided, to move food from the central dish to your own bowl.
- **Don't** stick your chopsticks upright in your rice bowl. This resembles incense sticks offered to the dead and is a
  serious taboo.
- **Don't** use your chopsticks to point at people or dishes.
- **Don't** tap your chopsticks on the side of your bowl.

### Paying the Bill, Toasting, and Tea

- The host almost always pays the bill. Fighting over the bill is a common ritual, but as a guest, you should allow your
  host to pay. Splitting the bill (AA制) is rare unless among young, close friends. For more information, see our [*
  *Beginner’s Guide to Traveling in China**](/beginner-travel-guide-china).
- Toasting is common at banquets. When someone toasts you, it is polite to take a sip. When clinking glasses, hold your
  glass slightly lower than your host's or an elder's to show respect. "干杯" (gānbēi) literally means "dry cup," but
  you are not always required to finish your drink.
- If someone refills your teapot, you can tap your index and middle fingers on the table twice as a silent "thank you."

## The Art of Gift-Giving

Gifts are exchanged to show appreciation and build relationships.

- **When to Give:** Gifts are appropriate for holidays like Chinese New Year, when visiting someone's home, or as a
  thank you for a significant favor. They are less common in casual business meetings.

- **Presentation:** Wrap gifts in red, gold, or pink paper. Avoid white, black, or blue wrapping paper, as these colors
  are associated with funerals.

- **What to Avoid:**

    - Clocks (送钟, sòng zhōng) sound like "attending a funeral."
    - Sharp objects like knives or scissors, as they imply severing the relationship.
    - White flowers, especially chrysanthemums, which are used for funerals.

- **The Ritual:** Present and receive gifts with both hands. Your gift may be politely declined a few times before it is
  accepted—this is a show of modesty. Do not open a gift in front of the giver unless invited to do so. Before you
  travel, check our guide on [**What You Can and Cannot Bring into China**](/china-customs-guide).

## Business Etiquette Essentials

For business travelers, professionalism is defined by respect and protocol.

- **Punctuality:** Arrive on time or slightly early for meetings.
- **Business Cards:** Exchange business cards with two hands, with the text facing the recipient. Take a moment to read
  the card you receive before putting it away carefully.
- **Dress Code:** Business attire is conservative. Opt for modest, professional clothing.
- **Communication:** WeChat is the primary tool for business communication. Following up with a contact on WeChat is
  standard practice.
- **Banquets:** Business deals are often solidified over a meal. Participate in toasts and sample the food offered. The
  banquet is an extension of the meeting.

## Visiting Temples and Cultural Sites

Show respect when visiting historical and religious sites.

- **Dress Modestly:** Wear clothing that covers your shoulders and knees.
- **Follow the Rules:** Obey all signs. Do not touch artifacts, statues, or murals unless permitted.
- **Temple Etiquette:** Walk through temple doorways without stepping on the threshold. If locals are burning incense or
  praying, be quiet and unobtrusive.
- **Photography:** Ask for permission before taking photos of monks or worshippers. Photography may be forbidden inside
  certain halls. For travel safety tips, see our [**China Travel Safety Tips guide**](/china-travel-safety-tips).

---

## Photography and Online Conversations

- **Asking Permission:** Always ask for permission before taking close-up photos of people, especially children or
  ethnic minorities. It is considered rude not to.
- **Sensitive Areas:** Do not take photos of military installations, police checkpoints, or other government facilities.
- **Conversation Topics:** In public, it's best to avoid sensitive political discussions. Safe topics for small talk
  include food, travel, your hometown, and family.
- **Internet Environment:** Respect the local online environment. Many foreign websites and apps are not directly
  accessible. For more details, review our [**Guide to Internet Access in China**](/china-internet-access-guide).
  Official laws and regulations can be referenced on the [National People's Congress](http://www.npc.gov.cn/englishnpc)
  website.

## Special Considerations

### Traveling with Children and Seniors

China is generally family-friendly.

- Using strollers on public transit can be challenging due to crowds and stairs. A baby carrier may be more practical.
- Locals are often delighted by foreign children but may get very close or try to take photos. A polite "no, thank
  you" (不要,谢谢 - bùyào, xièxie) is usually sufficient if you are uncomfortable.

### Accessibility and Inclusivity

- Patience is key. Norms are different, not better or worse.
- For LGBTQ+ travelers, public displays of affection are uncommon for all couples, regardless of orientation. Discretion
  is generally advised to ensure a comfortable and private experience.

## FAQ: Quick Etiquette Questions

- **Is tipping expected?** No. Tipping is not a part of Chinese culture and can sometimes be seen as rude. The exception
  is for tour guides and drivers on organized tours.
- **Should I stand in line?** Yes. Queuing is now the standard in most public places.
- **Do I need to take my shoes off in someone's home?** Yes. Always remove your shoes upon entering a home and accept
  the slippers offered.
- **How do I give a taxi driver my address?** Have the address written down in Chinese characters or saved as a
  screenshot on your phone.
- **Are hand gestures the same?** Be careful. The "come here" gesture with a crooked index finger is used for animals.
  To beckon someone, extend your arm palm-down and wave your fingers toward yourself.

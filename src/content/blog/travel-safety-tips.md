## 1. Always Carry Your Passport or a Copy

In China, foreigners are legally required to carry their passports with them at all times. You may be asked for
identification when checking into hotels, buying train tickets, entering tourist sites, or during random police checks
in public areas. Hotels will register your stay with the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) for you, but if you stay in
a private residence, you must register yourself at the local police station within 24 hours.

- **Do:** Keep your physical passport secured in a money belt or hotel safe.
- **Do:** Carry a clear photocopy or a high-quality digital picture of your passport’s photo page and visa page on your
  phone for quick checks.
- **Don't:** Leave your passport unattended in an easily accessible bag, especially in crowded places.

## 2. Use Official Taxis and Rideshare Apps

Transportation scams can be an issue, particularly for new arrivals at airports and train stations. Unlicensed "black
cabs" may overcharge you or use faulty meters. To avoid this, stick to official transport options.

- **Do:** Use official, marked taxis from the designated taxi queue and ensure the driver starts the meter.
- **Do:** Use reputable ridesharing apps like DiDi Chuxing (China’s version of Uber), which you can link to an
  international credit card.
- **Don't:** Accept rides from unsolicited drivers who approach you inside airport or station terminals.

## 3. Master Mobile Payments Safely

China operates as a nearly cashless society where mobile payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay are dominant. While
cash is still legal tender, many smaller vendors may not have change. Fortunately, both Alipay and WeChat Pay now have
programs allowing tourists to link international credit cards (like Visa or Mastercard).

Set this up before or upon arrival for a much smoother payment experience. It's still a good idea to carry a small
amount of emergency cash, just in case.

## 4. Be Aware of Common Tourist Scams

While China has a low rate of violent crime, petty theft and tourist scams can occur. Be vigilant in crowded markets,
tourist spots, and on public transport. Common scams include:

- **The "Teahouse" Scam:** A friendly stranger invites you for a traditional tea ceremony but leaves you with an
  outrageously high bill. Politely decline unsolicited invitations.
- **The "Art Student" Scam:** Students invite you to a gallery to see their work, then pressure you into buying
  overpriced art.
- **Fake Taxis:** Unofficial taxis might have rigged meters or take unnecessarily long routes. Stick to official cabs
  from the queue.

If a situation feels too good to be true or makes you uncomfortable, it’s best to walk away.

## 5. Follow Food and Water Safety Rules

Food is a highlight of any trip to China, but a few precautions can prevent an upset stomach. Stick to busy restaurants
where food turnover is high. Street food can be delicious, but choose vendors that look clean and are popular with
locals.

Crucially, **do not drink tap water**. It is not considered potable.

- **Do:** Drink only bottled, filtered, or boiled water.
- **Do:** Use bottled water for brushing your teeth.
- **Don't:** Accept ice in your drinks unless you are in a high-end establishment that uses filtered water.

## 6. Navigate Crowds and Streets with Caution

Chinese cities are bustling, and traffic can be chaotic. Even when you have a green light at a pedestrian crossing,
always look both ways before you step out. Cars and electric scooters may not always yield to pedestrians. Pay close
attention in bike lanes, as they are often crowded with fast-moving electric bikes that make very little noise. In
crowded subway stations or markets, keep your belongings secure and close to you.

## 7. Be Respectful with Behavior and Photos

Showing respect for local culture will enrich your travel experience. When visiting temples, dress modestly by covering
your shoulders and knees. Avoid loud conversations in quiet public spaces like museums.

Be mindful when taking photographs. It is forbidden to photograph military installations, and you should avoid taking
pictures of police or public protests. If you are unsure whether a site is sensitive, it's better to put your camera
away.

## 8. Understand and Respect Strict Local Laws

Respect for local laws is non-negotiable. China has a zero-tolerance policy on illegal drugs, and penalties are severe,
including long prison sentences or even capital punishment. Do not possess, use, or traffic any illicit substances.

Drunk driving is also a serious criminal offense with harsh penalties, including potential jail time. If you plan to
drink, use a taxi or a designated driver.

## 9. Know Your Emergency Numbers

In case of an emergency, it's vital to know who to call. Save these numbers in your phone:

- **Police:** 110
- **Ambulance:** 120
- **Fire:** 119

For non-emergency consular assistance, have the contact information for your country's embassy or consulate in China
readily available.

## 10. Stay Connected Smartly

Many Western websites and apps (like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) are blocked in China. To stay connected,
many travelers prepare in advance. You can purchase a local SIM card, use an eSIM, or enable international roaming on
your current plan.

Although some tourists use VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) to access blocked sites, their use exists in a legally gray
area and is not officially approved. For more detailed information, read our comprehensive [**Guide to Internet Access
in China**](/internet-access-in-china).

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: What happens if the police stop me?**\
A: Stay calm and be cooperative. The police will likely just want to see your passport for a routine check. This is why
it’s important to always carry your passport or a clear copy.

**Q: Is it legal for a tourist to use a VPN in China?**\
A: The legality of using a VPN is a gray area. While many tourists use them without issue, they are not officially
approved by the government. It's best to research the latest situation before your trip.

**Q: What if I need to go to a hospital?**\
A: Major cities have international hospitals and clinics with English-speaking staff, but they can be expensive. Local
public hospitals are capable, but you may face language barriers. This is why having good travel health insurance is
crucial.

**Q: Can I drink the tap water in China?**\
A: No, you should not drink tap water anywhere in China. Stick to sealed bottled water or water that has been boiled.
Hotels usually provide a kettle and two free bottles of water per day.

**Q: Is it safe for a woman to travel alone in China?**\
A: Yes, China is generally considered very safe for solo female travelers. Violent crime is rare. Standard precautions
apply: be aware of your surroundings at night, avoid unlit areas, and don't share your accommodation details with
strangers.

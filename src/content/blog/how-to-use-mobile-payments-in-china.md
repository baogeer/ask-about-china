Welcome to the future of payments. In China, the days of fumbling for cash or swiping a credit card are nearly gone.
Life runs on two apps: Alipay and WeChat Pay. From paying for a street-side snack to booking a high-speed train ticket,
everything happens with a quick scan of a QR code. For a first-time visitor, this can seem daunting, but it's the key to
unlocking a smooth and modern travel experience.

This guide will demystify the entire process for international tourists. We'll walk you through setting up Alipay and
WeChat Pay with your foreign bank card, show you how to use them in daily situations, and provide essential
troubleshooting tips. Getting your payments sorted is a critical step, just as important as securing your visa or
booking your flights.

For a seamless start to your trip, you'll need reliable internet. Our guides on [**internet access in China
**](/internet-access-in-china) and getting an [**expat SIM card**](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china) are essential
reading before you dive in.

## 1. Why Mobile Payments Are Essential in China

China has leapfrogged traditional banking infrastructure, moving directly to a mobile-first economy. While you won't be
completely stuck without mobile payments, relying solely on cash or cards will significantly limit your experience and
create daily friction.

**Where Cash & Cards Still Work:**

- **Cash (CNY):** It's always wise to carry some cash (500-1000 CNY) as a backup. Some small, independent vendors, local
  markets, and certain taxi drivers might still prefer it. It is also required for deposits at some hotels.
- **International Credit Cards (Visa/Mastercard):** Accepted at major international hotel chains, high-end restaurants,
  luxury brand stores, and airports. They are not accepted for most everyday purchases.

**Daily Scenarios Where Mobile Payments Dominate:**

- **Convenience Stores:** Buying a bottle of water or a snack is a simple QR scan.
- **Restaurants & Cafes:** From fast food to fine dining, you'll either scan the restaurant's code or have them scan
  yours.
- **Taxis & Ride-Hailing:** Didi Chuxing (China's Uber) is fully integrated with mobile payments.
- **Public Transit:** Paying for subway and bus rides is done via a transit QR code within the apps.
- **Attractions & Tickets:** Booking tickets for museums, parks, and shows is often done online via mini-programs within
  Alipay or WeChat.
- **Shopping:** Virtually all stores, from massive malls to tiny market stalls, use QR codes.

## 2. Quick Start: Requirements & Checklist

Getting started is easier than you think. You do not need a Chinese bank account or a Chinese phone number to set up
mobile payments as a tourist.

### What You Need:

- **A Valid Passport:** You'll use this for identity verification.
- **A Smartphone:** With a working camera to scan QR codes.
- **Reliable Data:** An active phone number with data roaming, a local SIM card, or an eSIM.
- **An International Bank Card:** Visa, Mastercard, JCB, Discover, and American Express are widely supported for linking
  to the apps. Debit cards work, but credit cards are generally more reliable.
- **An Email Address:** For account creation and verification.

## 3. Alipay for Tourists: Step-by-Step Setup

Alipay is generally considered the more foreigner-friendly of the two apps, with a dedicated international version and
higher transaction limits for tourists.

### Step 1: Download and Register

1. Download the Alipay app from your phone's app store.
2. Open the app and select the international version if prompted.
3. Sign up using your home country's phone number. You will receive an SMS verification code.

### Step 2: Real-Name Verification

This is a mandatory step for security and compliance (Know Your Customer or KYC).

1. In the app, navigate to your profile by tapping "Account" or "Me."
2. Find the "Real-name Verification" or "Identity Information" section.
3. Select your nationality, then enter your full name (exactly as it appears on your passport), passport number, and
   date of birth.
4. You will be prompted to take a photo of your passport's information page. Ensure the photo is clear and all details
   are readable.
5. Verification is usually instant or takes just a few minutes.

### Step 3: Add Your International Bank Card

1. Go to the "Me" tab and select "Bank Cards."
2. Tap "Add Card" and enter your international credit or debit card number.
3. Fill in the required details, such as the expiration date and CVV. You may also need to provide the billing address
   associated with the card.
4. Alipay will make a small verification charge to confirm the card is active, which is usually refunded.

### Spending Limits & Fees

- **Transaction Limits:** For linked international cards, Alipay has a single transaction limit of 5,000 USD, a monthly
  limit of 50,000 USD, and an annual limit of 60,000 USD (as of late 2024, subject to change).
- **Fees:** For transactions under 200 CNY, there are no fees. For transactions over 200 CNY, a 3% fee is charged. This
  is often more favorable than typical currency exchange rates.

## 4. WeChat Pay for Tourists: Step-by-Step Setup

WeChat is China's "super-app," combining messaging, social media, and payments. While its primary function is
communication, WeChat Pay is equally widespread.

### Step 1: Create a WeChat Account

1. Download WeChat from your app store.
2. Sign up using your phone number. Note: New international users may need a "security verification" from an existing
   WeChat user to activate their account. This can be a friend or someone you meet.

### Step 2: Enable WeChat Pay (Weixin Pay)

1. Once your account is active, go to the "Me" tab.
2. Tap on "Services," then "Wallet." If you don't see "Wallet," you may need to have someone send you a small digital "
   red packet" (hongbao) to activate the feature.
3. Follow the prompts to enable WeChat Pay. This involves setting a 6-digit payment PIN, which you will use for every
   transaction. **Do not forget this PIN.**

### Step 3: Link Your International Card

1. Inside "Wallet," tap on "Cards."
2. Select "Add a Card" and follow the steps for real-name verification, which are similar to Alipay's (requiring
   passport information).
3. Enter your international card details and complete the verification process.

### Limits and Comparison

- **Limits:** WeChat Pay generally has lower transaction limits for foreign cards compared to Alipay. The single
  transaction limit is typically around 6,000 CNY (\~$800 USD), with monthly and annual caps.
- **Alipay vs. WeChat Pay:** While both are accepted almost everywhere, Alipay often has a smoother setup process and
  higher limits for tourists. It's a good idea to set up both as a backup.

## 5. Paying in the Wild: How It Works

There are two primary ways to pay:

1. **You Scan the Merchant (Most Common):** The vendor has a printed QR code at their counter. You open your app (
   Alipay/WeChat Pay), tap the "Scan" button, point your camera at their code, enter the amount, and confirm with your
   PIN or facial ID.
2. **The Merchant Scans You:** For larger retailers like supermarkets or chain restaurants, the cashier will scan your
   personal payment code. Open your app, tap "Pay" or "Money," and a unique QR/barcode will appear. The cashier scans
   it, and the amount is automatically deducted.

- **Splitting Bills:** One person pays the full amount, and others can instantly transfer their share using the app's "
  Transfer" function.
- **Refunds:** If you need a refund, the merchant will typically process it back to your original payment method through
  their system.
- ***Fāpiào*****&#x20;(Receipt):** If you need an official receipt for business expenses, ask for a *fāpiào*.

## 6. Transit, Tickets, and Hotels

Mobile payments simplify travel logistics immensely.

- **Metro & Bus:** In Alipay or WeChat, search for "Transport" or "Ride Code" and select the city you're in (e.g., "
  Beijing Subway"). Follow the prompts to generate a transit-specific QR code. Scan this code at the turnstile to enter
  and exit; the fare is deducted automatically. Our [**transportation in China guide**](/transportation-in-china) has
  more details.
- **Didi & Taxis:** Didi is seamlessly integrated with both apps. For taxis, some now accept QR payments, but always ask
  first.
- **High-Speed Rail:** You can use Alipay/WeChat Pay at ticket kiosks in train stations.
- **Hotels:** While you can pay for your final bill with mobile payments, hotels require a security deposit at check-in.
  This is usually done as a "pre-authorization hold" on a physical credit card or by paying a cash deposit. Refer to our
  guides on [**How to Book a Hotel in China**](/) and the [**Beijing Airport Arrival Guide
  **](/beijing-airport-arrival-guide) for more on hotel check-in procedures.

## 7. Troubleshooting & Common Errors

Sometimes, payments fail. Here are common issues and what to do.

- **"Card Not Supported":** Your bank's card type (BIN) might not be on the approved list. **Fix:** Try a different
  card (e.g., Visa instead of Amex, or a credit card instead of a debit card).
- **"Verification Failed / KYC Mismatch":** The name or passport number you entered doesn't exactly match your bank's
  records. **Fix:** Double-check every detail for typos and re-submit.
- **"Risk Control":** A security feature has been triggered, often with large or unusual first-time transactions. **Fix:
  ** Try a smaller amount first. Sometimes waiting a few hours resolves it.
- **"Network Timeout":** Poor data connection. **Fix:** Move to a spot with better reception or connect to Wi-Fi.

**Workarounds:**

- **Cash:** Your ultimate backup.
- **Ask a Friend:** A local friend or guide can pay for you, and you can pay them back in cash.
- **Use In-App Payments:** For services like Didi, the payment is processed within the app, which can sometimes be more
  reliable.

## 8. Safety & Scam Avoidance

Mobile payments are very secure, but basic precautions are wise.

- **Verify Merchant Name:** When you scan a merchant's code, their registered business name appears at the top of your
  screen. Ensure it matches the shop you're in.
- **Never Transfer to Personal Wallets:** Scammers may ask you to transfer money directly to a personal account instead
  of a business account. Decline this. Official merchants use business QR codes.
- **Check the Amount:** Always confirm the amount on your screen before entering your PIN.

The merchant processes the refund back to your Alipay/WeChat Pay wallet, which then returns the funds to your linked
card. This can take several business days.

**4. What happens if I lose my phone?**\
Immediately use another device to log into your account and freeze it, or contact your bank to block the linked card.
Set a strong lock screen password on your phone.

This is rare but can happen with very small, local vendors. In this case, you will need to use cash.

connection. The merchant needs to be online to scan it.

**8. Is tipping possible through the apps?**\
Tipping is not customary in China and is not integrated into the payment process. See our [**China travel tips
**](/china-travel-tips) for more on etiquette.

**9. Can I use my home country's visa to verify my account?**\

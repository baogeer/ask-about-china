## Understanding Common Visa Categories

China offers various visa types based on your reason for travel. While policies can change, here are some of the most
common categories for foreign visitors:

- **Tourist Visa (L):** For individuals traveling to China for tourism. See
  our [China Travel Safety Tips](/travel-safety-tips) for planning your itinerary.
- **Business Visa (M):** For those visiting for commercial or trade activities.
- **Student Visa (X1/X2):** The X1 visa is for long-term study (over 180 days), while the X2 is for short-term study.
- **Work Visa (Z):** For individuals who have secured employment in China. This visa requires conversion to a residence
  permit upon arrival — see [What Foreign Workers Should Know About Working in China](/working-in-china).
- **Family Visas (S/Q):** The S visa is for visiting foreign family members working or studying in China, while the Q
  visa is for visiting Chinese citizens or foreigners with permanent residence.
- **Transit Visa (G):** For transiting through China to another country. Learn
  about [China’s 72/144-hour visa-free transit policy](https://www.travelchinaguide.com/embassy/visa/free-72hour/) (

## Typical Required Documents

You will generally need to prepare the following:

  pages.
- **Application Form & Photo:** The completed online application form and a recent, compliant passport-style photograph.

  see [Most Common Scams in Beijing](/most-common-scams-in-beijing) to avoid travel pitfalls.
- **Proof of Funds:** In some cases, you may need to show you can support yourself financially.
- **Invitation Letter:** Required for M, F, S, and Q visas. For work (Z) and student (X1/X2) visas, official documents
  like a Notification Letter of Foreigner’s Work Permit or a JW201/JW202 form are necessary.

## Understanding the Fees

Visa fees vary significantly based on your nationality, the number of entries you request (single, double, or multiple),
and the processing speed. Many countries have reciprocal fee agreements with China. Additionally, you will usually pay a
separate service fee to the visa application center.

You can check the current [visa fee schedule](https://www.visaforchina.cn/global/fee_schedule.html) on the official
CVASC website.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Inconsistent Information:** Ensure all details on your application form match your supporting documents.
- **Incomplete Paperwork:** Double-check that you have all required documents before your appointment.
- **Booking Non-Refundable Travel:** It's wise to wait for visa approval before purchasing non-refundable flights or
  tours.
- **Misunderstanding Entries:** A single-entry visa is valid for one trip only. Overstaying your visa can lead to
  serious consequences — see [China Travel Laws & Regulations](/legal-guide-to-traveling-in-china) for more.

## Tips for First-Time Applicants

- **Apply Early:** Start the process well in advance of your planned travel date.
- **Check Official Sources:** Visa policies are subject to change. Always verify the latest requirements on the official
  website of the Chinese embassy or visa center in your country. Recent updates have included streamlined online forms
  and pilot visa-free entry programs for citizens of certain countries.
- **Consider Travel Insurance:** A good policy can provide peace of mind — compare international plans via
  [Allianz Travel Insurance](https://www.allianztravelinsurance.com) or [AXA](https://www.axa.com/).
- **Register Upon Arrival:** By law, all foreigners must register with local police within 24 hours of arrival. Hotels
  do this for you automatically, but if you're staying in a private residence, you must register at the local Public
  Security Bureau (PSB) yourself.

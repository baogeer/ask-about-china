## 1. Documents & Visas: Your Entry Essentials

Getting your paperwork in order is the most critical first step. Without the right documents, your trip can end before
it starts.

### Passport and Visa Requirements

Your passport must be valid for at least six months beyond your planned date of entry into China. Ensure you have at
least two blank pages for the visa and entry/exit stamps. Most international travelers will need a tourist visa (
L-visa).

The application process typically requires submitting your passport, application forms, photos, and supporting documents
like flight and hotel confirmations. For a complete walkthrough of the process, including visa types and application
centers, see [Your Essential Guide to Applying for a Chinese Visa](/apply-for-chinese-visa).

### Important Documentation to Prepare

- **Proof of Onward Travel:** Have a copy of your return or onward flight ticket confirmation.
- **Accommodation Proof:** Keep booking confirmations for at least your first few nights. Border officials may ask to
  see them.
- **Arrival Card:** You will fill out an arrival card upon entry. Complete it fully and accurately.
- **Digital and Physical Copies:** Make photocopies of your passport’s photo page, your Chinese visa, and your flight
  confirmations. Save digital copies in a secure cloud storage service (like Google Drive or Dropbox) and on your phone.

Upon arrival, your fingerprints may be collected as part of the immigration process. This is a standard procedure. For
more information on entry requirements and staying compliant, review
our [Legal Guide to Traveling in China](/legal-guide-to-traveling-in-china).

## 2. Health, Insurance & Medications

Taking care of your health preparations ensures peace of mind while you're away.

### Travel Insurance

Comprehensive travel insurance is non-negotiable. Your policy should include:

- **High Medical Coverage:** Healthcare for foreigners can be expensive.
- **Medical Evacuation:** This covers the cost of transporting you to a suitable medical facility or back home in a
  serious emergency.
- **Trip Cancellation & Interruption:** Protects your investment if unforeseen events force you to cancel or cut your
  trip short.

### Medications and First-Aid

If you take prescription medication, bring enough for your entire trip, plus a little extra. Keep all medicines in their
original, clearly labeled packaging. It is also wise to carry a copy of your prescription and a doctor's note explaining
your condition.

Pack a basic first-aid kit with essentials like pain relievers, antiseptic wipes, bandages, and stomach-settling
remedies. Pharmacies are common in cities, but having your own supplies is convenient.

### Health Precautions

Consult your doctor or a travel clinic 4-6 weeks before your departure to discuss any recommended vaccinations or health
precautions for traveling to China. Emergency numbers in China are **120** for an ambulance and **110** for police.

## 3. Money & Payments: Your Financial Toolkit

China's payment landscape is highly digital, but a mix of payment methods is the best strategy for travelers.

### Cash, Cards, and Digital Wallets

- **Cash (Chinese Yuan - CNY/RMB):** Essential. While major cities are moving toward a cashless society, cash is still
  necessary for smaller vendors, some taxis, and as a backup. You can withdraw CNY from ATMs at airports and in cities.
- **International Cards (Visa/Mastercard):** Accepted at major international hotels, high-end restaurants, and large
  department stores. They are not widely accepted at smaller businesses.
- **UnionPay:** If you have a UnionPay card, it will be accepted almost everywhere.
- **Alipay and WeChat Pay:** These are the dominant payment methods. As a tourist, you can link your international
  credit card to both apps, allowing you to scan QR codes to pay like a local.

For a detailed walkthrough, see our guides on [internet access in China](/internet-access-in-china) and how to set up
payments with an [expat SIM card](/expat-sim-card-guide-for-china).

### Budgeting and Money Safety

A typical daily budget can range from $50–$70 USD for a budget traveler to $150+ for a mid-range experience, excluding
long-distance transport. To stay safe, avoid carrying large amounts of cash. Use a money belt and be mindful of your
surroundings, especially in crowded areas.

## 4. Phones, SIMs & Internet: Staying Connected

Internet access in China requires some planning. Your home SIM card's roaming plan might be slow or expensive.

### Your Connectivity Options

- **eSIM:** The most convenient option. Purchase and install a China-specific eSIM before you travel.
- **Local SIM Card:** You can buy a SIM card upon arrival at the airport or from a major carrier store (China Mobile,
  China Unicom, China Telecom). You'll need your passport for real-name registration.
- **Roaming:** Check with your home provider about their roaming packages for China. This is often the most expensive
  choice.

### VPNs and Essential Apps

Many Western websites and apps (like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) are blocked in China. A Virtual Private
Network (VPN) is commonly used to access them. For more on this topic, read our guide
to [internet access in China](/internet-access-in-china).

Download these apps before you go:

- **WeChat (Weixin):** The all-in-one app for messaging, payments, and more. It is the primary communication tool in
  China.
- **Translation App:** An app like Google Translate or Microsoft Translator with offline language packs is invaluable.
- **Offline Maps:** Download maps of the cities you'll visit (e.g., on Maps.me or Google Maps offline feature).

## 5. Itinerary & Transport Logistics

A well-planned itinerary makes your trip more efficient and enjoyable.

### Planning Your Route

China is vast. Don't try to see everything in one trip. Focus on one or two regions. Be aware of major national holidays
like Chinese New Year (Jan/Feb) and Golden Week (first week of Oct), when hundreds of millions of people travel, making
transport and accommodation difficult and expensive to book.

### Getting Around China

- **High-Speed Rail:** The best way to travel between cities. It’s fast, clean, and efficient. Book tickets in advance,
  especially around holidays.
- **Domestic Flights:** A good option for covering long distances, connecting regions not served by high-speed rail.
- **Urban Transport:** Major cities have excellent, bilingual metro systems. For ride-hailing, Didi is the dominant app.

For comprehensive details on navigating the country, check our guides
on [transportation in China](/transportation-in-china) and general [China travel tips](/china-travel-tips). Always be
cautious of transportation scams, which are common in busy hubs. Our guide
to [scams in Beijing](/most-common-scams-in-beijing) has useful pointers.

## 6. Booking Stays the Smart Way

Finding the right place to stay involves more than just picking a hotel with good reviews.

As we cover in detail in our [**How to Book a Hotel in China**](/) guide, the most important step is ensuring the
property is licensed to host foreigners. Booking a hotel that isn't licensed will result in being turned away at
check-in. Use filters on booking sites like Trip.com to show only eligible properties.

Always save the hotel’s name and address in Chinese characters on your phone. This is incredibly useful for showing taxi
drivers. Finally, notify your hotel if you plan to arrive late to prevent your room from being released.

## 7. Safety, Laws & Etiquette

Understanding local laws and customs ensures a respectful and trouble-free visit.

### Laws and Regulations

- **PSB Registration:** All foreigners must register with the local Public Security Bureau (PSB) within 24 hours of
  arrival. Hotels do this for you at check-in; if staying with a friend, you must do it yourself.
- **Carry Your ID:** Always have your physical passport or a clear photo of it on your phone. Police can perform random
  checks.
- **Restricted Items:** Be aware of items that are controlled or illegal in China. This includes certain publications
  and a strict ban on illicit drugs. Drone usage is heavily regulated, especially in cities.

Our [Legal Guide to Traveling in China](/legal-guide-to-traveling-in-china) offers more specifics on local laws. Be
vigilant against common tourist scams, particularly in popular areas. Our guide
to [scams in Beijing](/most-common-scams-in-beijing) is a helpful resource.

### Cultural Etiquette

- **Respectful Conduct:** Be quiet and respectful at temples and historical sites.
- **Queuing:** Line-cutting can happen, but forming an orderly queue is the norm in most modern settings.
- **Gifts:** When giving or receiving items, it's polite to use both hands.

## 8. Packing & Power

Smart packing will make your journey much more comfortable.

### What to Pack

- **Clothing:** Pack according to the season and region. Layers are always a good idea. Bring modest clothing for
  visiting temples (cover shoulders and knees).
- **Comfortable Shoes:** You will do a lot of walking.
- **Power Bank:** Essential for keeping your phone charged on long travel days.
- **Universal Adapter:** China uses Type A and Type I plugs. A universal adapter is your best bet. The standard voltage
  is 220V.

Also, bring a physical, printed backup of key addresses, hotel bookings, and flight numbers in case your phone battery
dies.

## 9. Language & On-the-Ground Tips

You don't need to be fluent in Mandarin, but a few basics will go a long way.

### Communication

- **Translation Apps:** Use a voice translation app for simple conversations.
- **Show, Don't Tell:** For addresses or menu items, show the Chinese characters on your phone.
- **Hotel Business Card:** Always grab one from the front desk. It has the hotel’s address in Chinese, making your
  return trip easy.

### Practical Tips

- **Useful Phrases:** Learn "Nǐ hǎo" (Hello), "Xièxiè" (Thank you), and "Duōshǎo qián?" (How much is it?).
- **Deposits:** It’s common for hotels and sometimes even restaurants to require a cash deposit.
- **Receipts (Fapiao):** A *fapiao* is an official receipt for business expenses. As a tourist, you generally won't need
  one.

## 1. Always Carry Your Passport or a Copy

In China, foreigners are legally required to carry their passports with them at all times. You may be asked for
identification when checking into hotels, buying train tickets, entering tourist sites, or during random police checks
in public areas like subway stations.

- **Do:** Keep your physical passport secured in a money belt or safe hotel pocket.
- **Do:** Carry a clear photocopy or a high-quality digital picture of your passport’s photo page and visa page on your
  phone for quick checks.
- **Don't:** Leave your passport unattended in an easily accessible bag or pocket, especially in crowded places.

Registering your accommodation is also mandatory. Hotels will do this for you at check-in. If you are staying with
friends or in a private rental, you must register with the local police station (Public Security Bureau) within 24 hours
of arrival.

## 2. Use Official Taxis and Rideshare Apps

Transportation scams can be an issue, especially for new arrivals at airports and train stations. Unlicensed "black
cabs" may overcharge you or use faulty meters.

- **Do:** Use official, marked taxis from the designated taxi queue. Ensure the driver starts the meter.
- **Do:** Use reputable ridesharing apps like DiDi Chuxing (China’s equivalent of Uber). You can link an international
  credit card.
- **Don't:** Accept rides from unsolicited drivers who approach you inside the airport or station terminals.

Having your destination address written in Chinese characters is a great help. Show it to your driver to avoid
confusion.

## 3. Master Cashless Payments Safely

China is a nearly cashless society. Most locals use mobile payment apps like Alipay and WeChat Pay for everything. While
cash is still legal tender, many smaller vendors may not have change.

Fortunately, both Alipay and WeChat Pay now allow tourists to link international credit cards (like Visa or Mastercard)
to their apps. Set this up before or upon arrival.

- **Do:** Download and set up Alipay or WeChat Pay and link your bank card.
- **Don't:** Rely solely on cash, especially outside major tourist hotels and restaurants.
- **Do:** Carry a small amount of emergency cash just in case.

## 4. Be Aware of Common Tourist Scams

While China is generally very safe with low violent crime rates, petty theft and tourist scams exist. Be vigilant in
crowded markets, tourist spots, and on public transport.

Common scams include:

- **The "Teahouse" Scam:** A friendly stranger invites you for a traditional tea ceremony but leaves you with an
  outrageously high bill. Politely decline unsolicited invitations from strangers.
- **The "Art Student" Scam:** Students invite you to a gallery to see their work, then pressure you into buying
  overpriced art.
- **Fake Monks:** Individuals dressed as monks may ask for donations or sell trinkets at inflated prices. Official monks
  do not solicit money on the street.

If a situation feels too good to be true or makes you uncomfortable, it’s best to walk away.

## 5. Follow Food and Water Safety Rules

Food is a highlight of any trip to China, but a few precautions can prevent an upset stomach. Stick to busy restaurants
where food turnover is high. Street food can be delicious, but choose vendors that look clean and are popular with
locals.

**Crucially, do not drink tap water.** It is not potable.

- **Do:** Drink only bottled, filtered, or boiled water.
- **Do:** Use bottled water for brushing your teeth.
- **Don't:** Accept ice in your drinks unless you are in a high-end hotel or restaurant that uses filtered water.

## 6. Understand China's Strict Laws

Respect for local laws is non-negotiable. China has a zero-tolerance policy on illegal drugs, and penalties are severe,
including long prison sentences or even capital punishment.

Avoid engaging in political discussions or participating in any public demonstrations. Be mindful when taking
photographs; it is forbidden to photograph military installations or police and government buildings in some areas. If
you are unsure, it's better not to take the picture.

## 7. Use Pedestrian Crossings with Caution

Traffic in Chinese cities can be chaotic. Even when you have a green light at a pedestrian crossing, always look both
ways. Cars and electric scooters may not always yield to pedestrians. Pay close attention in bike lanes, as they are
often crowded with fast-moving electric bikes that make little noise.

## 8. Know Your Emergency Numbers

In case of an emergency, it's vital to know who to call. Save these numbers in your phone:

- **Police:** 110
- **Ambulance:** 120
- **Fire:** 119

For non-emergency consular assistance, have the contact information for your country's embassy or consulate readily
available.

## 9. Secure Your Internet Connection

Many Western websites and apps (like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp) are blocked in China. To stay connected,
many travelers prepare in advance.

- **Do:** Research your options for staying connected, such as purchasing a local SIM card or using international
  roaming.
- **Do:** Be aware that VPN usage is a legally gray area.

## 10. Respect Local Customs and Etiquette

Showing respect for local culture will not only keep you out of trouble but also enrich your travel experience. Tipping
is not customary in China and can sometimes be seen as rude. When visiting temples, dress modestly (cover your shoulders
and knees) and behave respectfully. Avoid loud conversations in quiet public spaces like museums or temples.

precautions apply: be aware of your surroundings at night, avoid unlit areas, and don't share your accommodation details

insurance is crucial.
